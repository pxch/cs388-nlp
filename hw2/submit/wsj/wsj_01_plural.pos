Mr. NNP

If IN

Mr. NNP

The DT

This s DT

'' ''
The DT
prevailing VBG
interpretation NN

that IN

interpretation NN

officially RB

in IN

As s IN

a DT
`` ``

that IN

( (

Thus s RB

with IN

repeals s VBZ
the DT

Section NN

unconstitutional JJ

ability NN

The DT
language NN
of IN
the DT

implies s VBZ
that IN

of IN
a DT

will MD
result VB
in IN
the DT

The DT

could MD
probably RB
not RB
avoid VB
this s DT
restriction NN
by IN

people NNS
willing JJ
to TO
serve VB
without IN

, ,
because IN
the DT
Anti-Deficiency NNP

The DT
1990 CD
appropriations s NNS

contain VBP
a DT
number NN
of IN
`` ``

provisions s NNS
that WDT

the DT

in IN
Article NNP
II NNP
of IN

Muzzling JJ
provisions s NNS
, ,
which WDT

be VB
called VBN
`` ``

as s IN

prevent VBP

looking VBG

certain JJ

let VB
alone RB
from IN

Such JJ

violate VBP
the DT
provision NN
in IN
Article NNP
II NNP
that WDT
requires s VBZ
the DT

to TO
make VB

to TO
Congress s NNP

which WDT
gives s VBZ
the DT

the DT
discretion NN
to TO
select VB
the DT
subject JJ

of IN
those DT

Typically RB
, ,
these DT

seek VBP
to TO
prevent VB

officials s NNS
from IN
inquiring VBG

whether IN
certain JJ

any DT
economic JJ
sense NN
or CC

more JJR
market-oriented JJ
alternatives s NNS

Probably RB
the DT
most RBS
egregious s JJ
example NN
is s VBZ
a DT
proviso NN
in IN
the DT
appropriations s NNS

for IN
the DT
executive NN

that WDT

the DT

There EX

something NN
inherently RB

Perhaps s RB
none NN
of IN
the DT
unconstitutional JJ
conditions s NNS
contained VBN
in IN
the DT
appropriations s NNS

for IN
fiscal JJ
1990 CD
better RBR
illustrates s VBZ
Congress s NNP

attempt NN
to TO

Section NN
609 CD
of IN
the DT

: :
`` ``

The DT

in IN
INS NNP

that IN

If IN

President NNP

By IN

though IN

If IN

unworkable JJ
because IN
it PRP
would MD
leave VB

The DT

However RB
, ,
the DT

does s VBZ
have VB

The DT

constitutional JJ

that WDT

merely RB
because IN

The DT
excision NN
of IN

in IN
an DT

would MD
be VB
a DT

One CD

that WDT

the DT

There EX

no DT

If IN

( (
assuming VBG

President NNP

In IN
that DT

he PRP

that WDT
