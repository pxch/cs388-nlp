Format specification SENSEVAL-2 results

The results of a system's processing should be reported in a single
file corresponding to the evaluation data file, with one line for each
test instance in the evaluation data.  The lines in this results file
do not have to be in any particular order.

Each line should include the following items, in the specified order:

1. reference id for the task (depending on lex-sample or all-words)
2. a single space
3. reference number for test instance (depending on lex-sample or all-words)
4. a single space
5. list of sense tags with or without weights
6. an optional comment

If the sense-tag list is weighted, the weights (given as integers or
real numbers, and separated by a "/" from the sense tag) will be
normalised.  That is, they will be treated as probabilities.  If any
of the sense tags are missing weights, then none of the weights will
be used.  When there are no weights, a uniform distribution is used.

In case the results file contains two or more lines for the same
reference number from the same evaluation file, the first such line
will be counted as the system's answer and the subsequent lines will
be disregarded.

Examples of well-formed lines:

bother 00001 501566
bother 00002 501566     999997     !!
bother 00006 501566/0.5 501573/0.4 503751/0.1
bother 00015 503751/94  999999/87             !! comment . . .

If you are into BNF, here's a precise definition:

<lexical_sample_answer>
   ::= <lexelt> <instance_id> <sense_tag_list> [!! <comment>]

<all_words_answer>
   ::= <text_id> <head_id> <sense_tag_list> [!! <comment>]

<lexelt> ::= lexical element (as defined in the lex-sample evaluation data)
<instance_id> ::= instance id (as defined in the lex-sample evaluaiton data)
<text_id> ::= text id (as defined in the all-words evaluation data)
<head_id> ::= head id (as defined in the all-words evaluation data)

<sense_tag_list> ::= <weighted_list> | <unweighted_list>
<weighted_list> ::= <senseid>[/weight] {<senseid>[/weight]}
<unweighted_list> ::= <senseid> {<senseid>}

<senseid> ::= senseid from the lexicon for the task
<weight> ::= integer or positive real number
<comment> ::= text string
