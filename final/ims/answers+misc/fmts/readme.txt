			   Data Formats for Senseval

Senseval is a contest for word sense disambiguation (WSD) systems.  In hosting
the contest, the coordinators wish to develop a means of evaluating the
systems.

Senseval defines 3 possible "tasks", one of which is inherently not
standardizable (the "in a system task").  The remaining tasks ("lexical
sample", and "all-words") present a number of requirements and challenges for
the design of the relevant data formats.

	Challenges:

	1) No redundancy.
	2) Every element of data is unambiguously identified with a minimum
	   of necessary information.
	3) Easy human annotation.
	4) Simplicity of the format.

	Requirements:
	
	1) Multi-lingual format involving multiple character encodings.
	2) Flexible mapping from lexical entries to textual instances.
	3) It must be feasible for humans to annotate the data without
	   supporting software (eg using a text editor).
