Whatever flickerings of potential this young tyro possesses, they cannot cover up the fact that he is a painter with the imagination of a retarded adolescent; no technical mastery; no intuitive feeling for pictorial space; no sensitivity towards, or grasp of, tradition; and a colour sense rather less than that of Congo, the chimpanzee who was taught (among other things) a crude responsiveness to colour harmonies by Desmond Morris in the late 1950s.
However, potentially educable as a painter Schnabel may or may not be, his work is just not worthy of serious attention by anyone with a developed taste in this particular art form. [/p] [/quote] [/p] [p]
Readers need also to be wary of the existence of special markets.
The explosive prices for Teddy Bears in the last few years indicate how a [pb] market can be created, in this case by a mix of merit and nostalgia.
What is clearly a dealers' market is often signalled by the invention of a brand name to group together a variety of material, perhaps rather disparate.
Pop <head>Art</head>is an example.

Widening horizons: investing in the arts [/head] [p]
The arts benefit society in two ways.
First, access to the arts is intrinsic to a high quality of life.
Second, the cultural sector &mdash; the arts, crafts, design, and audiovisual industries &mdash; makes as great a net contribution to the economy as does the oil industry.

Therefore if we carry ourselves with pride, our self-esteem increases and others will notice. [/p] [p]
If someone does come looking for trouble, he or she will pick a victim who does not look capable of causing any real problem.
We need to make it clear by the way we stand and hold a gaze, and by the way we speak, that we cannot be so easily dismissed.
In fact we have to show that we are prepared, if necessary, to do whatever it takes to survive.
I'm not talking about aggression, but about asserting ourselves &mdash; firmly and resolutely.
We can still give our opponent the chance to back off, we can still use reason, but he or she must realize that the wrong person has been picked for breakfast.

Alfred Reginald Thomson, R.A., R.P., (1894&ndash;1979) &mdash; War Artist [/head] [p]
All branches of the armed services at various times made appointments of official War Artists, who were commissioned to paint battle scenes or portraits for the armed services.
In 1942 one such appointment was made of a deaf artist, Alfred Reginald Thomson, as official War Artist to the Royal Air Force. [/p] [p]
A.R.
Thomson was born in Bangalore, India, in 1894 and was educated at the Royal School for Deaf Children, Margate, in England before he went to study <head>art</head>at the London Art School, Kensington, and exhibited at the Royal Academy from 1920.

Most of the teachers in grammar schools were graduates of universities: many, but by no means all of them, had also taken a one-year course of teacher training after completing their undergraduate studies.
The exceptions were the teachers in such subjects as physical education, art, and the crafts.
The domination of the curriculum by subjects classically defined was, indeed, the most obvious feature of the grammar-school curriculum.
That curriculum needed relatively little adjustment across the pre- and post-War years.
The contrast for the eleven-year-old with the more informal and less specialist work of the primary school was sharp and abrupt.
English, mathematics, a foreign language (usually French), Latin (often but not always), the sciences, history, geography, some <head>art</head>and crafts, but not too much, PE and games, the compulsory religious education: these were the invariable components of the first two or three years of a grammar-school education.

I would therefore argue that one of the chief tasks of education, perhaps its overriding task, is the education and encouragement of a child's imagination, so that he may not be a slave to a perception confined solely to the present, a perception that is little more than blindness.
The teaching of history is one part of such an education; the encouragement of creativity is another, and there are others still. [/p] [p]
After primary school, the encouragement of the imagination in children, and the cultivation of specifically creative activities, has often been thought an optional part of the curriculum, a luxury that may have to be dispensed with, left in, if at all, for the less able pupils deemed incapable of serious learning or for that minority determined to reject &bquo;scientific&equo; understanding.
Imagination has been associated especially with the <head>arts</head> , and thus in recent years has been increasingly downgraded.

It was not all going to be wine and roses; [pb] and Leonard again felt the sharp problem of the Canadian writer at that time &mdash; having a small home market, not wishing to become artistically part of the &bquo;53rd State&equo; of America, and yet having nowhere else to go.
As Layton said, &bquo;I still regret that we got no encouragement from the CBC, because I think that we would have gone on to write plays.&equo; [/p] [p]
So it was that they went on to do other things, but separately; a &bquo;beautiful&equo; working relationship was thereby broken up, and two highly creative thinkers had their play-writing ambitions stillborn.
(This was not, in fact, the end of Leonard's ambitions in that regard.
In [hi]Flowers for Hitler [/hi], pp 110ff, he published his &bquo;The New Step&equo;: a ballet-drama in one act; and an involvement in film-making would help to sublimate it, as we shall see.) [/p] [p]

By piercing hundreds of news-cuttings with barbed-wire, Jarman intends his most wounding attack on the tabloids' attitude to homosexuality.

Though the anthology is broadly chronological, texts are not all directly about art movements.
Thus their second section, &bquo;The Idea of Modernity&equo;, includes two sub-sections entitled &bquo;Modernity&equo; and &bquo;Cubism&equo;.
The former has fourteen texts ranging from manifestoes by Malevich and Marinetti to extracts from Bergson, Simmel, Weber and Karl Kraus; the latter has twelve more familiar texts on Cubism.
Later on, issues surrounding Pop Art and post-war abstraction are bracketed together in a section called &bquo;Modernization and Modernism&equo;.

Only when they have examined what hands, arms, legs and feet, body and above all the head can do in isolation and then in harmony with the story, theme or music, can they set out and create a style which will be general in structure and particular in texture, with the right quality, mood, emotion, action and character.
The structure will determine the lines and shapes needed to fill the dimensions and, when needed, help to create the atmosphere and mood of the whole.
Choreographers must then decide how many and which details they need to add to disclose the particular features of the story, theme and/or music that they wish to communicate. [/p] [p]

He was advised in the arts by the century's greatest antiquaries, Jacopo Strada and his son, Ottavio.
As pointed out by the collector and historian van Mander writing in 1604, &bquo;Whoever so desires nowadays has only to go to Prague to the greatest <head>art</head>patron in the world at the present time; there he may see at the Imperial residence a remarkable number of outstanding and precious, curious, unusual, and priceless works.&equo;

YOU have to wonder what the Bush administration was looking for when it set out, in early 1989, to find a new chairman for the National Endowment for the Arts.

Consider the Japanese word for the martial arts as a whole: budo.
It means, literally, &bquo;the way to stop the spear&equo;.
Less esoterically, it means &bquo;to stop fighting&equo;, as does the Chinese word for the martial arts, wushu.
The true aim of the martial arts is to avoid conflict; it is best summed up in one commentator's description of aikido as &bquo;the honourable art of getting the hell out of the way&equo;.
The aggression, if there is any, is controlled.
In the eyes of good practitioners self-control allows them to find a path around conflict. [/p] [p]
To some westerners this seems pseudo-philosophical bunkum, but East Asians take it seriously.
Most, if not all, of the martial <head>arts</head>are inextricably linked to the three main East Asian religions, Buddhism, Taoism and Confucianism.

The suggestive outlines of a hierarchy of disdain can be traced: the &bquo;tragic Garbo&equo; is preferred to Mickey Rooney, Betty Boop to Donald Duck; their most acerbic denunciations are reserved not for &bquo;amusement&equo; or &bquo;light&equo; art in themselves, but for the attempt by the Culture Industry to absorb &bquo;light&equo; into &bquo;serious art&equo;, accommodating difference to the familiar &mdash; &bquo;Benny Goodman appears with the Budapest string quartet&equo;.

Rasheed Araeen writes a lot, very confidently, about modernism.
Strange, isn't it, or perhaps not so strange, that the word is so much used by theoreticians and so little used by artists themselves? [/p] [p]
I would like to have read more on the subject by Frank Bowling, whose views seem not to be harmonised with Araeen's somewhat dogmatic viewpoint.
Bowling resembles a number of older artists in the exhibition in that he came to England (from Guyana, in his case) to be an artist, had some success, then moved to and fro between London and New York when his public career went downhill in the Sixties.
Could it be that there was then more racism in the <head>art</head>world, and that Black artists were being squeezed out at just the time when young working-class artists from the British provinces were finding unprecedented and immediate public fortune?

Moreover, men such as the great ecclesiastical architect Abbot Suger of St Denis (c. 1081&ndash;1151), who devoted his later years to composing a laudatory life of the French monarch Louis VI (1081&ndash;1137), effectively a second founder of the Capetian dynasty, wrote history with the object of producing favourable propaganda rather than documentary facts.
Suger's historical writings led the monks of his abbey to develop a taste for history and hence to compile a series of chronicles.
In the same century universal history also flourished, mainly with the object of determining the end of the world, after the year 1000 had passed without any sign of its impending occurrence.
This type of history was, of course, theologically rather than politically orientated.

Critics no less than artists have wide interests in the arts, and may introduce comparisons in their interpretations.
In the nineteenth century to say that a picture was poetic was a common term of praise.
In the present century emphasis on formal qualities in the visual arts have made musical comparisons more frequent, emphasised by the use by artists of musical terminology, as when Kandinsky chose to call his works Improvisations and Compositions.
According to this formalist approach art aspires to the condition of music, a phrase employed by Pater, but deriving from classical Greece. [/p] [p]

A large set of genes concerned with mimicry in butterflies became tightly linked together on the same chromosome, so tightly that they can be treated as one gene.
In Chapter 5 we met the more sophisticated idea of the evolutionarily stable set of genes.
Mutually suitable teeth, claws, guts, and sense organs evolved in carnivore gene pools, while a different stable set of characteristics emerged from herbivore gene pools.
Does anything analogous occur in meme pools?

Part of this passage has been italicised to draw attention to the somewhat presentist presupposition that underpins much of this book.
In qualifying &bquo;scientific&equo; by &bquo;in a broad sense&equo; Kemp shows that he is aware of this problem.
However, the presentist influence is all too pervasive.
His frequent appeals to &bquo;scientific concepts&equo; and &bquo;scientific ideas&equo; often presuppose an unambiguous definition of science and one that is atemporal. [/p] [p]
The difficulty is most apparent when discussing the Renaissance since by hypostatising science and art as two separate and separable activities Kemp is framing a problem that did not exist for the historical actors.
Take the example of Brunelleschi who, according to Kemp, introduced &bquo;scientific consistency&equo; into his use of perspective (p. 14).
The phrase suggests that Brunelleschi was engaging in an activity other than <head>art</head> .

Terry Friedman's book contains fourteen chapters, which chart the development of the work and its public reception &mdash; a stormy one.
The topics include the first design, the sculptor's aims, the carving of the work, the memorial's defenders and attackers, and a final general reflection on the standing of great art and how it is likely to provoke opposition.
The monograph is accompanied by a facsimile of a sketchbook for the memorial, and documented by letters and printed sources, including articles in the press.

It is not surprising that this controversial Directive has not met the 1993 deadline, which the UK, centre of the European art market, says will drive the trade to the US, Switzerland or elsewhere.
The EC proposes to tax imports from outside the EC by applying the reduced rate of tax to the full price, or, in the case of those countries like the UK and Denmark which do not have a reduced rate, the standard rate to 30% of the price.
Exports from the EC, on the other hand, would be exempt, which, the UK maintains, in the long run will leach works of art from the EC countries.
At present, the UK operates a margin scheme (ie; it applies tax only to the difference between the purchase and the sale value) and exempts from VAT imports of paintings and works of art created before 1 April 1973 and items older than one hundred years.
It argues that, even at a reduced rate, VAT on imports from outside the EC would seriously damage the London <head>art</head>market.

Latin American art has been undergoing such a review both from within Latin America itself and from elsewhere, with several exhibitions and books on the subject in the last few years in Europe and the US.
That there should be an issue of the [hi]Oxford Art Journal [/hi] devoted to Latin American art is itself testimony to the success of such efforts. [/p] [p]
But new categories can in turn prove to be exclusive.
Within the field of Latin American art as a whole there are still many individual artists who have not received the attention they deserve because their work does not seem to fit into any larger pattern.
In the case of the work of the Mexican Alberto Gironella, the reason would seem to be precisely because of his insistent concentration on <head>art</head>of a very different category &mdash; that of Spain during the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, particularly court portraiture.

Many writers interested in these phenomena tend to specialise either in child play or in the arts, the former finding clues in the activity which relate to child development, the latter establishing art as an enhancement of what is good and beautiful.
Narrowing the field to either one or the other of these, has sometimes trapped the theoreticians into claiming that they have identified a defining characteristic of their field.
For instance, Arnaud Reid (1982), in arguing that what all the variety of art forms have in common is the requirement of &bquo;aesthetic intention&equo;, explains: [quote] [p]
For &mdash; cutting straight through the recurring controversies about whether, because of the varieties of the <head>arts</head>and of the infinity of differences between different individual works, &bquo;art&equo; can be &bquo;defined&equo; &mdash; one thing, I think, is clear.

The fall of Tarentum in 272 BC and the ravages of the wars of the Romans against Pyrrhus of Epirus, conducted in south-east Italy, led to the decline of the Greek cities of southern Italy and Sicily.
Pliny perhaps had this in mind when he wrote that art ceased in 296 BC.
Archaeological evidence points to a slightly later break, with a gap in the production of fine pottery, paintings and metalware from about 250 to 210 BC.
It may also be argued that Roman military advances effectively changed the artistic map of Italy.
Roads built to reach newly founded Roman colonies and to transport armies by-passed long-established cultural centres, leaving them to decay.
Other new centres were to flourish. [/p] [p]

``The Thief and the Dogs'' is a pioneering work, the first
stream-of-consciousness novel in Arabic, but it is likely to disappoint
Western readers.  The 1981 novel ``Wedding Song'' also is experimental, and
another badly aimed bullet.  The story of a playwright's stage debut
unfolds in first-person monologues, in the manner of Faulkner's ``The Sound
and the Fury.'' But the device obscures more than it illuminates.  Buried
in the work is a meditation on the morality of art, and on the struggle for
integrity in an unfair world.  But again, the themes get tangled in Mr.

Although Heathrow authorities have been watching a group of allegedly
crooked baggage handlers for some time, the Gauguin may be ``lost.'' Chief
Inspector Peter Seacomb of the Criminal Investigation Department at the
airport said, ``It is not uncommon for property to be temporarily mislaid
or misrouted.'' Officials at the University of Virginia Art Museum
certainly would agree.  Their museum had purchased an Attic black-figured
column krater and shipped it from London.  It was reported stolen in
transit en route to Washington, D.C., in February.  Months later, the Greek
vase arrived in good condition at the museum in Charlottesville, having
inexplicably traveled by a circuitous route through Nairobi.  Two Mexican
college dropouts, not professional <head>art</head> thieves, have

In such situations, he says, the house ``is going to put the best light on
things.'' For example, an auction house's comments on the condition of a
work of art that is up for sale should be looked at with ``very open eyes,''
he says.  ``There's more and more of this cash-up-front going on at every
level,'' says Bruce Miller, president of Art Funding Corp., an art lender.
Dealers and auction houses ``know if they do n't lay out a half a million
for this, another one will; it's that competitive.'' In January, two small

a major <head>art</head> collection owned by the Askin family away

In very general terms, what has characterized recent tendencies in the theoretical study and the practical teaching of language has been a distrust of authority and of the rules and conventions through which it is exercised.
Thus in the theoretical study of language the deference previously accorded to analysis and explanation by the informed observer has been questioned in favour of an uncommitted approach to enquiry, without preconception and without privilege, into the ways in which participants negotiate their own conditions for achieving their purposes.
And in language teaching, the idea that the teacher should direct the progress of learners has been questioned on the grounds that such direction impedes the natural process of learning.

But even more remarkable is the case of the Roman Republic, where for a century designs referring to the moneyers completely supplanted the symbols of the state; the moneyers had the freedom to choose their own personal designs, such as family achievements or origins (see fig. 15).

Some reasons against the acceptance of authority pertain, with varying force, to many situations.
One recurring kind of reason against accepting the authority of one person or institution is that there is another person or institution with a better claim to be recognized as an authority.

Equally important in building a framework for the future was the role played by the most anonymous of the ECSC's institutions, the Court of Justice.
Almost from the beginning, it was involved in hearing complaints relating to the operation of the ECSC.
Nearly all the cases that came before the Court were appeals by national governments and industries against decisions of the High Authority.
What was significant was that the vast majority of these appeals were rejected, and that while the Court had no means of enforcing its opinion, its verdicts were accepted, if not immediately implemented.

If Christianity is true and if religion affects culture, then non-Christian religions, whose creeds must at some point involve the denial of some aspect of Christian truth, will reveal cultural problems resulting from inconsistencies which are impossible to reconcile given their religious postulates. [/p] [p]
The relevance of this can be seen by considering the present religious force in Western culture, namely a humanism which finds its embodiment in liberalism.
Ever since the Renaissance, but particularly since the Enlightenment of the eighteenth century, Western culture has become imbued with a humanistic and a libertarian spirit.
As a religion humanism affirms some [pb] important absolutes.
It starts by proclaiming that God is dead or what comes to the same thing, that if he exists he is irrelevant.

Similarly, the Labour government's policies on the reduction of the number of private pay beds did not always lead to enthusiastic implementation in the late 1970s.
A possible justification of the increased politicisation of appointments is more confidence in authorities and hopefully, a reduction in the need for detailed central interventions. [/p] [p]

Much of the resistance to the dependence thesis comes from confusing it with a claim about what authorities do in fact, or with the view that requires authorities to act only in the interests of their subjects.
But the most common confusion is between the dependence thesis and the no difference thesis, which was briefly discussed in the last chapter.

Although there is some experience of contracting in such services as catering and cleaning, the scale of the programme set out in the White Paper is of a different order.
Initially, most contracts are likely to include only a broad specification of the service being purchased.

Third, before entering negotiations about contracts, purchasers will have to make an assessment of the services required to meet the health needs of their population.

In the &bquo;real process&equo; of policy implementation, local authorities may follow a pattern of action drawing on several of the types sketched here.

The origins of this popular movement lie in the first wave of pressure for disarmament, which began with the emergence of the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament (CND) in 1958 and ended in 1964, with its decline in the face of the new Labour Government's failure to rid itself of nuclear weapons.
Resistance focused initially on nuclear testing and the existence of American bases on British soil, but it quickly broadened to encompass unilateral nuclear disarmament in general and a rejection of the Polaris missiles favoured by the then Conservative Government in particular.
The period was marked by mass demonstrations, of which the Aldermaston marches were the most successful as well as the best remembered, and by more direct forms of action such as well-planned and highly publicized sorties against selected US rocket bases situated in Britain.

Supporters of civil disobedience, notably a loose, unholy alliance of Scottish Nationalists and the Militant Tendency -both out to embarrass law-abiding Labour councils as much as the Government &mdash; are adamant that a mass non-payment resistance is being mobilised, particularly on Scotland's huge, outer-city housing estates.
They point to hundreds of disaffected Labour voters being attracted to protest meetings. [/p] [p]
The Government is equally adamant that councils' financial problems are being exaggerated and that the civil disobedience campaign is flopping. [/p] [p]
The true picture lies somewhere between these extremes.

In chapter 2 I discussed one of the central aims of the English curriculum, which is to extend the range of language in which children are competent.
Many children in our schools speak languages other than English.
For these children, therefore, this means adding competence in Standard English to their competence in other languages.
English is clearly the &bquo;first language&equo; of the education system.
But it would be a great loss if pupils' knowledge of a range of other languages was to decline. [/p] [p]
The distribution of bilingual children varies widely across the country, but the total numbers and diversity are certainly significant.

Although the speculations of a few Italian statesmen about the African shores of the Mediterranean hinted at the patterns of future international rivalry, the powers for the most part displayed in 1880 an almost complete preoccupation with European interests and lack of sensitivity about the rest of the world.

While the interests which ruled the foreign policies of European states might differ, the machinery which put them into effect did not.
Since the Congress of Vienna, a general diplomatic system had provided the accepted channels of international relations.

Good examples of activities to maintain motivation are collecting inspiring dieting case histories from slimming magazines; going out to buy a dress one size smaller than your present size; looking at charts and graphs that show good overall weight loss over a period of time.

Two final issues among the host remaining for consideration will be touched upon.
First, should the couple in the type of marriage unions discussed above be able to adopt children, since obviously there will be no natural issue?

We tested the OF 450S router, a 450 watt machine with a 1/4in collet capacity and a no-load speed of 27,500rev/min.

AEG has taken a fairly established design of router, and fine&rehy;tuned it to become a much more easy to use machine than the Bosch.

I soon found myself at the Gasthof L&ocirc;wen in the little village of Sasbach. [/p] [p]
Sasbach is really no more than a scatter of houses, a couple of shops, a garage and a church set down in the middle of vineyards and orchards.
From it, one road crosses the Rhine into France and Colmar, the other takes you to Breisach and Freiburg.
It is a pretty village.
The houses are pink or yellow with white sills and dark shutters.
Even prettier was the petite brunette of about seventeen who showed me to my room.

HOLIDAY resorts don't come much louder than Benidorm.
So you'll be surprised to learn that the town's tourist bosses are now taking urgent steps to control late-night noise. [/p] [p]
A map has been produced to show exactly what level of decibels the music in each street is allowed to reach. [/p] [p]
The map is colour-coded, easy to follow and essential for anyone booking a holiday in the resort. [/p] [p]
It will be particularly useful for early risers who once had to endure deafening music from Benidorm bars until the small hours.
All they have to do is pick a hotel or apartment away from the disco areas. [/p] [p]
Any <head>bar</head> or disco which exceeds its permitted decibel limit can be shut down on the spot for the night by police.

The first step of the stairs was actually in the room, the protruding edge being well rounded to avoid barked shins.
In the centre of the opposite wall was a kitchener grate, with a small compact fire only about 12 inches &times; 10 inches &times; 10 inches, which not only kept the room beautifully warm, but also provided heat for a quite sizeable oven on the left and a hob large enough to take three saucepans.

The subject of bar codes is one which seems to crop up in reader's letters from time to time.

Code Cracking [/head] [p]
Many people seem to think that bar codes carry a lot of information.
For example, if you read the contents of a bar code on a can of baked beans, the common belief is that you would get something along the lines of &bquo;Heinz Baked Beans, 225g, 38p&equo;.
This seems reasonable, because reading the <head>bar</head> code into a supermarket checkout system would result in this sort of information being displayed, and printed on the receipt. [/p] [p]

The basic idea is that you look through the book until you find a picture that is of the type you are going to take, and you then read the accompanying bar code into the camera.
Its programmed exposure system then sets the most suitable shutter speed and aperture under the prevailing circumstances.
If you are taking some sort of action shots for instance, the camera will set fast shutter speeds (to freeze the action) and use wide apertures if the light level is indifferent. [/p] [p]
Such a feature is clearly a waste of time if you are a reasonably expert photographer (and there is no bar code reader input on the professional EOS models), but it helps the non-expert to get good results.
Another use of bar codes is in security applications, and there must be many other novel uses for them. [/p] [/div2] [div2] [head]

When you are doing the first draft, label as many points on the axes as possible. [/p] [/div4] [div4] [head]
Plotting the points on a scatterplot [/head] [p]
Plot each point carefully, using a symbol such as a cross; if more than one point lands on the same spot, you could plot the number of points represented (i.e. the numeral 2 if two points are superimposed).
Inspect the result and decide if it would look better if you stretched or shrunk the scale. [/p] [/div4] [div4] [head]
Drawing a bar chart [/head] [p]
Arrange the bars in some sensible order, such as in order of their lengths.

As the community church was formed, the vision was for &bquo;intimacy&equo;.
It was not in this case a call to work in a particular area of the community, but rather it was a call to intimacy.
Intimacy with God, with each other, and with the neighbourhood in which we lived, following the example of Jesus in John 1:14: &bquo;The Word became flesh and lived for a while among us.&equo; [/p] [p]
The call was reflected in the name we eventually chose for the church: Cranham Community Church.
We had from the outset a desire to cross barriers that had previously existed and to get involved in community groups.
We considered buying a coffee <head>bar</head> and being a presence in the market place, but we realised this would not be a suitable place for Sunday worship, and our attempts to buy a suitable shop were consistently blocked.

These can be interpreted in a similar way to the maps of the Z2 Carbonate, with a belt of porous oolitic grainstones coinciding with the thickest part of the formation.
Between this belt and the basin margin, lagoonal sediments can be expected and beds of porous bioclastic grainstone may occur locally in this situation.

This approach more than adequately disposes of the particular point at issue in the [hi]Pickin [/hi] case but does not, as is hardly surprising, answer a number of questions which were not asked: [pb] [/p] [p]
(a) Was the provision in question valid?
The House of Lords did not decide either that it was, or that it was not.
They simply, and it seems correctly, decided that it was none of their business.
Whose business, then, is it?
Either House of Parliament is perfectly capable of resolving that any of its previous decisions is to be regarded as a nullity.
If the House of Commons had done so in relation to the allegedly offending provision under review in [hi]Pickin's [/hi] case, would the provision nevertheless have remained valid? [/p] [p]

In November Mr Symington, a Republican developer, narrowly beat his Democratic opponent, Mr Goddard, at the ballot box, but he won only 49.7% of the vote.

A number of brewers now use a device called a cask breather on low volume beers to prolong their life.

When the pub landlord or cellarman considers that the beer is ready to serve &mdash; it is said to have &bquo;dropped bright&equo; with the sediment of yeast in the belly of the cask, and to have matured sufficiently &mdash; a long plastic tube is connected to the tap and the beer is ready to be pulled to the bar.

Many people seem to think that bar codes carry a lot of information.
For example, if you read the contents of a bar code on a can of baked beans, the common belief is that you would get something along the lines of &bquo;Heinz Baked Beans, 225g, 38p&equo;.
This seems reasonable, because reading the bar code into a supermarket checkout system would result in this sort of information being displayed, and printed on the receipt. [/p] [p]
In reality matters re not as simple as this, and a do-it-yourself system that will provide a similar function is not a very practical proposition.
The problem is that the bar code only provides detailed information in an indirect fashion, and it is not readable straight from the code.
If you look at a <head>bar</head> code it will normally be accompanied by a long number (usually eight or thirteen digits long).

Arrange the bars in some sensible order, such as in order of their lengths.

As an interim proposal it has suggested a new line be built through Kent overground to a new terminal at Swanley, close to the M25, and the upgrading of the existing Waterloo line. [/p] [p]
Trafalgar House, BR's favoured partner, is reliably understood to have rejected the idea of building a terminal at Stratford and to be sticking to the final route chosen by BR.
It has submitted final proposals to ministers along with a range of options as to how the link might be built.
These include a government cash injection by way of loan stock, linked to an equity participation which would enable the Government to recoup some of its money if the line is a success. [/p] [/div1] [div1] [head]

The ammunition in the burning aircraft went off, weaving patterns of coloured tracer against the massive fires caused by burning fuel stores.
Then the anti-aircraft guns opened up, firing into the air against an imagined air raid.
Tiny figures in the distance, silhouetted against the flames, rushed about trying to extinguish the blazing hangars.

Finally in matching wants and resources one might be able to identify unmet needs, for which future services might be planned. [/p] [p]
In assessing needs a social service worker is doing three things: [list] [label]

The story of Doubting Thomas is told, not so that we shall admire Thomas, but so that we can admire the other apostles in comparison.
Thomas demanded evidence.
Nothing is more lethal for certain kinds of meme than a tendency to look for evidence.
The other apostles, whose faith was so strong that they did not need evidence, are held up to us as worthy of imitation.
The meme for blind faith secures its own perpetuation by the simple unconscious expedient of discouraging rational inquiry. [/p] [p]

&bquo;I don't think they would do almost anything to sell records or to get on.
They are interested in doing it in certain terms.
They are solid in their approach.

There was also a fair amount of discussion in this case about the meaning of the phrase &bquo;special educational provision&equo;.

Little is still known of the designers and speculators of this part of the town's growth, save that they were often little more than smallholders or jobbing builders who saw the possibility of some quick profits on their small capital.
The most notorious of these streets, Pimlico off Church Street, was a derelict slum within ten years of its building around 1820, and by the 1870s it had to be demolished.
The cumulative effect was to make Brighton the fastest growing town in England between 1811 and 1821; the new inhabitants soon gave the resort an &bquo;artificial&equo; unhealthy climate to add to its more &bquo;natural&equo; freshness.

K.449 was actually written for one of his pupils, Barbara Ployer, but the next two, K.450 in B flat and K.451 in D, were written for himself.
These works mark the beginning of a new maturity in Mozart's style, both in scoring (he now made full use of the range of instruments and good players available in Vienna) and in scope.
From now on wind instruments play an increasingly important role, engaging in independent dialogue rather than acting as &bquo;fillers&equo; for the strings.
All the orchestral music from 1784 onwards is conceived in broader strokes, while the solo parts become ever more complex. [ptr][/p] [caption]

The breadth of this term is useful, but it is necessary to use more specific reference to denote particular levels or types of visual problem in relation to the child's use of sight for learning.
The term &bquo;blind&equo; should be used carefully to describe those pupils who are completely without vision, or who have light perception only.
To use the term more widely may reduce the likelihood that the pupil will be encouraged to use any vision, however slight it may be. [/p] [p]
Clearly, <head>blind</head>pupils will be those who depend on tactile and auditory means of learning, and they will require specialised equipment and additional elements in their curriculum such as braille, mobility and orientation, but other aspects of their educational needs will include careful consideration of language development, concept formation, social interaction and information processing.

There are of course problems in bringing up a Down's child which are not present, at least to the same degree, in bringing up a child without Down's Syndrome.
And for as long as the public continue to be wary of, or feel sorry for Down's children, there will be a considerable social stigma to contend with.
It is therefore unsurprising to note that parents fear the prospect of having a child with Down's Syndrome, and seek to determine, at a prenatal stage, whether their child is suffering from this handicap.

This composition of pop suggests occasional rupture and random fun-quake, rather than a benign process of amelioration, or accumulating body of good work.
There is a history to be written of the VOICE in pop, the voice that makes present the physicality of the body.
Which has its own story: Jagger's lips, Hendrix's cock, Bolan's gin, Prince's tongue, Morrissey's nipple (one of the few options of indecency left, to revel, to splay oneself-as-object, play thing). [/p] [p]

Erm now what I want to say at the very very end is a quick observation by Beatrix Campbell who wrote a book about the Cleveland er child sex abuse scandal which took place in the late 1980's.
In Cleveland um there were a number of cases of child sex abused diagnosed, I think somewhere somewhere in the region of between one and two hundred altogether, by a controversial process called the anal dilation reflex.
That is um if you erm if you make children er sort of lie down on their fronts with their <head>bums</head> in their air and you and bums in their air and you touch anuses apparently the anus dilates, or it can do, erm allegedly in children who've been sexually abused in that way, in children who've been who've been penetrated anally.

Rodney Lines, editor of the Newsletter, and [corr] Baron [/corr] Wright taught me much that was new to me about a favourite poet.

This is a most pathetic piece of pontification, even if we appreciate that modern artists are some of the greatest censors of art (i.e. Rauschenberg erasing de Kooning).

Feeling &bquo;better than&equo; or &bquo;less than&equo; others. [/head] [p]
The Ego [hi]loves [/hi] making comparisons &mdash; and this can be useful.
After all, we are only able to see a chair, so that we can sit down, by comparing the look of the chair with the &bquo;look&equo; of the space around it.

The Ego needs to make comparisons, to fulfil its duty as a messenger. [/p] [p]

Although Modigliani had rejected Simone Thiroux's claim on his paternity, and her child, a boy, was born in the spring of 1917, he was happy to acknowledge that Jeanne was carrying his child.
His relations with her mother, however, were anything but happy.
Madame H&eacute;buterne was constantly disapproving and interfering.
Zborowski had rented an apartment in the Rue Mass&eacute;na, but Modigliani was restless and unsettled living in a constrained atmosphere.
After all those years in Paris he found the bright sunshine and the sparkling translucence of the air disturbed his concentration and made it difficult for him to work.

During his long stay in the south he made only one portrait with an out-of-doors setting; the pretty shopkeeper, sitting on a <head>chair</head> in front of her shop, looking out with uncomprehending suspicion against a white wall.

With the stickback style, however, it is only necessary to curve the top piece; the sticks would then position themselves into a curve, even from a straight base.
This base can be the rear seat rail, or another rail fitted above the seat, but if so, no more than 2in above the seat or it would also need to be curved to avoid discomfort.
The chair looks better to me if the seat is wider at the front than at the back, but the front of the seat should only be slightly wider than the top of the back.
Further on the point of comfort, a seat which slopes down slightly front to back is preferable to a horizontal seat. [/p] [p]
During a study of the various styles, it became apparent to me that if the back legs are set into the seat rails at an angle, this angle, together with the curvature of the rear legs and backward slope of the <head>chair</head> back can regulate the flair: if the legs are mounted at right angles to the rear seat rail, there would be no flair.

The &bquo;cheese&equo; is a local name for the pulped apples used in cider making and the stones are supposedly similar to the old cider presses until recently a feature of many a Cornish farm. [/p] [p]
A natural formation, geologists agree, but one story tells otherwise.
The Cheesewring was the result of the jealousy between the giants, who formerly held dominion over Cornwall, and the &bquo;invasion&equo; of saints and their growing influence over the Cornish. [/p] [p]
A meeting of the giants was called on Bodmin Moor to discuss the [pb] problem.
St. Tue, whose hermit's cell was nearby, heard of this and he attended the gathering to challenge Ulther, the leader of the giants, to a trial of strength.
If he lost, the saints were to leave Cornwall; and if he won, the giants were to consent to being baptised. [/p] [p]
The two champions were to hurl rocks on to a pile, (hurling rocks is a favourite sport of giants, as evidenced in C.S. Lewis's &bquo;The Silver <head>Chair</head> &equo;). [/p] [p]

The posts may not necessarily be particularly lucrative (regius professorships are worth &pound;100 a year, religiously paid in quarterly &pound;25 cheques), but they are at some of the pinnacles of national life, they open doors and they command respect.
Unlike other university appointments, which are made by faculty boards or governing bodies on the basis of academic achievement, there is no formal selection process, and no open competition for regius professorships.
Those who wish to be appointed must somehow solicit the good opinion of the prime minister's appointments secretary.

The basic principle of his chair is that the knees should be below the pelvis, a quite different principle to the design of most chairs.
The usual type of chair puts an enormous strain on the spine, back muscles and many of the internal organs.
Anyone sitting down for extensive periods (as we all had to do in our school days) would have to tense many of the body's muscles in order to sit up straight.
This, in turn, causes the organs, the bones and, ultimately, the entire system to be under stress. [pb] [/p] [p]
The forward-tilting chair allows the spine and the postural muscles to support and balance the body naturally.
You can easily see the effect by placing a telephone book under each of the rear legs of a ordinary kitchen chair.
At first, the sensation may seem strange but, after a few minutes, you will appreciate its comfort.

Unhappy endings were more familiar to the welfare workers.
Moritz, a Polish boy born in Cologne, was a smiling, good-looking child when he arrived in June 1939.
Aged thirteen, he spent two years at a Cardiff school, where he learned English, and then trained as an electrician.
About the time he started work he became obsessed that he would never see his parents again; he feared that they were already dead.
He was probably right.
Authority, any authority, was blamed for the tragedy.
Moritz antagonised his employer, who promptly sacked him, and refused help from his friends.
In 1942 he was persuaded to go into hospital, where he was said to be schizophrenic.
A year later he was certified insane.

In 1961 the British and French governments agreed to set up a working group to consider the merits of the rival proposals and at the beginning of 1964 Ernest Marples, the British Transport Minister, and his French counterpart announced that the two governments would go ahead with a tunnel.
In 1973 a [pb] start was actually made, but the following February the Heath Government fell.
Labour inherited three major public spending projects: the third London airport to be built at Maplin, the supersonic Concorde aircraft and the Channel Tunnel.
Labour wanted economies and the first project to perish was Maplin.
But that was not enough for the new Chancellor, Denis Healey.
In effect there was a choice between Concorde and the Channel Tunnel.
Concorde (which was to be partly built in Bristol) benefited from a strong local lobby including a local MP, Tony Benn, who had now become a member of the Labour Cabinet.
More to the point, it would cost more to cancel Concorde than the relatively paltry &pound;17 million it would cost to go back on the <head>Channel</head>Tunnel.

WAR CLOUDS OVER EUROPE read the banner headlines at the opening of Reed's earlier film, [hi]Bank Holiday [/hi] (1938), a picture whose setting suggests escapism but whose narrative argues for the need to face up to the dark side of life in order to find meaningful happiness.
Margaret Lockwood plays a nurse who, on the eve of a bank holiday, has to console a man whose wife has just died in childbirth.
Preoccupied with the thoughts of his suffering, the trivial concerns of her lover become increasingly aggravating as they hang around with the crowds at Brighton.
He seems over-concerned about what people think of them, to lust after her but not deeply love her.
Fearful that the widower will take his life, she rushes back to London, to a man grieving for a woman who once said to him: &bquo;don't be silly, there's no hurry, we've all our lives.&equo; [/p] [p]

It took all the courage he had to thrust his head and shoulders into the mouth of that entrance, but he closed his eyes and twisted and turned and after a time tumbled out into a great stone chamber, lit with a soft light of its own that dimmed the glitter of his shining key.
It was a miracle he thought, that the glass had not shivered in that tight struggle, but it was as clear and brittle as ever.
So he looked about him, and saw three things.
The first was a heap of glass bottles and flasks, all of them covered with dust and cobwebs.
The second was a glass dome, the size of a man, and a little taller than our hero.
And the third was a shining glass coffin, lying on a rich velvet pall on a gilded trestle.
And from all these things the soft light proceeded, like the glimmering of pearls in the depth of water, like the phosphorescent light that moves of itself on the night surface of southern seas, or shines round the heaving shoals, milky-white over their silver darts, in our own dark <head>Channel</head> .

The attractions of a sea-to-sea waterway had taxed the brains of both James Watt ( [hi]q.v. [/hi]) and John Rennie before Thomas Telford ( [hi]q.v. [/hi]) was commissioned by the Government in 1802 to construct the canal.
Its benefit was that shipping could avoid the dangerous passage round the north coast of Scotland and &mdash; as Britain was at war with France &mdash; there was great strategic value in providing a protected route for warships.
The canal took 18 years to complete, twice as long as Telford had forecast, and cost more than double what he had estimated, but it was an outstanding engineering achievement for the time, even though the actual length of genuine canal that had to be dug was only 21 miles, since the navigable <head>channel</head>took advantage of existing lochs along the glen.

Elevation of intracellular Ca [hi]2+ [/hi] by the photolysis of caged Ca [hi]2+ [/hi] induces a form of synaptic potentiation, but the relationship between this effect and LTP has not been determined (for example, occlusion experiments have not been done).
Elevation of intracellular Ca [hi]2+ [/hi], either by evoking Ca [hi]2+ [/hi] currents or by slowly depleting intracellular Ca [hi]2+ [/hi] stores, does not induce LTP.
This could be due either to the failure of these methods to elevate Ca [hi]2+ [/hi] in the appropriate manner (presumably what is needed is a large transient within spines) or to the need for additional pre- and/or postsynaptic signals. [/p] [p]
In summary, the available evidence suggests that under normal conditions Ca [hi]2+ [/hi] permeates NMDA <head>channels</head>to provide a transient signal which is necessary for the induction of LTP.

But, as so often, no one was prepared to halt the machine once set in motion and on Friday 26 January 1744 Admiral Jacques de Roquefeuil sailed out of Brest with a fleet of 22 ships, with instructions to cover the embarkation of the army at Dunkirk and then to lure the English fleet away towards the Isle of Wight. [/p] [p]
By the time de Roquefeuil had reached the island Admiral Sir John Norris, a first-class sailor, had assembled his force in the Downs off Dover.
On Saturday 17 February 1744 de Roquefeuil, having found the seas off the Isle of Wight apparently free of English warships, sent a despatch-boat to Dunkirk advising de Saxe to embark his men.
He then sailed on to Dungeness where Sir John Norris's fleet now appeared in strength.
It delayed attacking till the following morning, and a calm during the night enabled the French ships, showing no lights, to make their escape and simply drift down <head>Channel</head> , only to be overtaken around midnight by a ferocious north-east gale.

It is extremely rare for the Executive to lose the confidence of the House of Commons.
That it is so rare is due, in very large part, to [pb] the efficiency of the processes whereby the House, particularly the government party, lets it be known what it will and will not tolerate.

This e.p.s.p. can be blocked by the quinoxalinedione antagonists, such as 6-cyano-7-nitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione (CNQX), and is usually referred to as AMPA receptor-mediated after the selective ligand for these receptors [hi]&agr;- [/hi] amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionate (AMPA).
This receptor corresponds to the cloned family GluR1&ndash;4 [hi]47 [/hi].
When the Schaffer collateral-commissural pathway is stimulated it also activates GABAergic interneurons (through glutamatergic synapses similar to those on pyramidal neurons) and this leads to the biphasic i.p.s.p. which curtails the e.p.s.p.

WAC's most elaborate ruse to date was to turn up at the Republican convention in Houston and install batch after batch of 20-by-60-foot high feminist slogans (designed by Anderson, Kruger et al) which greeted Bush's nearest and dearest as they exited from the convention.
This Tank Girl-style posse is only seven months old, but already it has grown beyond the founders' wildest dreams.
Going for world domination, WAC is setting up branches all over America with planned outposts in Amsterdam and Paris.

More straightforwardly, awareness of another nation's literature helps to create for authors a sense of the particular character and limitations of their own, encouraging the pursuit of alternatives and possibilities for innovation and change.
If experimental novelists metaphorically stare across the Channel, it is not only because they hope some valuable contraband &mdash; fresh styles from France &mdash; may be smuggled through English literary customs.
It is because aspects of foreignness itself, of vision focused by contact with other nations and languages, may be a crucial encouragement to the sort of writing they produce. [/p] [p]

Calmodulin affinity chromatography has also been used to purify a related 63K/240K channel complex from pig and rat ROS membranes.
This suggests that the channel complex and its interaction with calmodulin is conserved, at least for mammalian ROS.
These results indicate that calmodulin affinity chromatography can be used to purify the cGMP-gated channel complex from ROS membranes and that the 240K channel-associated polypeptide binds calmodulin in a Ca [hi]2+ [/hi] -dependent manner.
On the basis of these findings, calmodulin modulation of the <head>channel</head>activity is likely to occur through Ca [hi]2+ [/hi] -dependent interaction of calmodulin with the 240K channel-associated protein.

As part of the normal processes of a river, the stones in these shoals are neatly sorted and graded by the flowing water into an overlapping fish-scale pattern known as &bquo;armouring&equo;, which makes them relatively stable.
By dredging up gravel, therefore, river managers were actually de-stabilizing the river bed, thereby contributing to the erosion which they were supposedly trying to prevent.
Riverside trees, whose roots increase the tensional strength of the bank material, are the best protection against erosion, especially if they are well established and are properly maintained.
They also reduce land loss, since it is estimated that <head>channels</head>with 50 per cent tree and shrub cover on both banks require only approximately half the width for a given volume of bankfull flood-water speeding through the channel, compared to treeless brooks which erode out into the adjacent fields.

The issues are obviously different for parents who relinquish a baby from those whose rights are later terminated by law and the child placed for adoption. [/p] [p]
Studies which illustrate the pain and distress many relinquishing mothers experience for years to come (sadly, information about fathers is unavailable) would suggest a more inclusive form of adoption (Panor and Baran, 1984; Winkler and Keppel, 1984).
For some birth parents this would mean periodic up-dating of information from themselves to [pb] the adoptive family and from the latter to the birth parents directly or through the placement agency. [/p] [p]

In June 1991, following the trauma in Orkney, the government announced categorically that no more children were to be taken from their homes by social workers in dawn raids.
The only exception would be if a child's life was in danger.
This became law immediately in England and Wales, and is part of the new Children's Act.
It was believed that similar action would follow very quickly in Scotland, where the Child Care Law Review was nearing completion.
This review of child-care in Scotland began before the children in Orkney were taken from their homes early on a February morning.
Its completion was delayed because of the case. [/p] [p]
In reviewing child-care law, the Scottish Office took submissions from every agency involved with the care, protection and management of children.
These included Social Work Departments, <head>children</head> 's homes, Children's Hearing Panels, voluntary organisations, and others.

The parents may be trying different techniques, coaxing and offering a wide variety of foods.

The purpose of this paper is to examine further the issue of open adoption or adoption with contact. [/p] [div2] [head]
BACKGROUND [/head] [p]
In 1984, the Court of Session in Edinburgh (Hay/Briton against Central Regional Council) refused a 53 year old grandmother custody or access to her six year old grandchild, though it was agreed that the &bquo;most significant relationship&equo; the child had was with this grandmother.
The Court's decision was largely influenced by the evidence of a psychologist who claimed that to award custody or access to the grandmother would diminish the child's prospect of developing &bquo;a balanced personality&equo;.
The report in the Scottish Law Times does not refer to any evidence to support the view that the maintenance of contact between a <head>child</head> and a birth relative to whom he or she has attachments would cause harm to the child's developing personality.

Nevertheless, it is remarkable that despite administrative differences, the problems facing residential care in Flanders and the Netherlands and the recent changes in policy are very similar to those found in the United Kingdom.
Indeed, those with knowledge of the British scene will recognize many of the points made about Flanders and the Netherlands.
For example, the regional distribution of residential and foster care services in the United Kingdom is known to be uneven [pb] with some local authorities using EBD schools and residential care far more frequently than others (Fuller and Stevenson, 1983).
Hence, whether a child is placed with a foster family or in residential care may not so much depend on the child's needs but on where he or she happens to live.
One local authority in England, Warwickshire, has closed all its residential provision for <head>children</head> in care.

Commentators in this school tend to emphasise class and economic variables as factors producing poor standards of child care, and to de-emphasise parental culpability and personal inadequacy.
Thus, in this view parents as well as children tend to appear as victims and, in particular, working-class parents are seen as vulnerable and powerless [hi]vis-&agrave;-vis [/hi] statutory agencies.
It is thought that the separation of children from poor parents, the keeping of children apart from parents and the removal of parental rights are undertaken too readily by these agencies.
Ideally, steps should not be taken to remove children from parental care unless there is clearly no other way to prevent harm to them and unless other options, such as day-care, financial and housing help, have been investigated first.
When <head>children</head> [hi]have [/hi] been removed, positive efforts should be made to rehabilitate them with their parents as soon as possible. [/p] [p]

ACCESS FOR PARENT OR PUPIL? [/head] [p]
In much of the discussion it has been assumed that it is a parent who seeks the information.
If access is seen as part of the right of autonomy of the individual, one might ask why parents, rather than the children themselves, should have access.
If it is seen as part of control over quality of education, the parent might ask why the child should be given access at all.

Hence, subject and support teachers will need to develop expertise in modifying curriculum materials [hi]and [/hi] managing behaviour problems. [/p] [p]
In conclusion, I am advocating that, as the whole-school approach grows in popularity as a positive response to children with special educational needs, it is important that schools, as organisations, and teachers, as individuals, reject the segregationist policy towards disruptive pupils which might appeal to some teachers and government policy makers.
By embracing the evidence from the &bquo;effectiveness of schools&equo; research and adopting a whole-school approach to special educational needs, we can create a truly comprehensive service of education in which it is accepted that ALL teachers have responsibility to meet the needs of ALL <head>children</head> .

The greatest effect of social mobility might be expected to be in the middle of the range, perhaps when fathers move from manual to non-manual jobs, for example. [/p] [p]
An increasingly popular measure of effect is the difference not in proportions but in log odds between two categories.
This turns out to be much the same as looking at ratios of odds, but avoids cumbersome multiplicative arithmetic. [/p] [/div3] [div3] [head]
Class effects on schooling [/head] [p]
In order to illustrate the construction of these different measures, consider again the original cross-tabulation of school type by class [pb] background (figure 7.5).
If we wanted to summarize the extent to which any type of school selected disproportionately from the <head>children</head> of particular class backgrounds, we might use the difference between the service and the working class in the proportion attending that school.

The solution was to operate independently, to abide by the unwritten rules of royal management and not let the Prince and Princess get into a position where they were competing for the limelight except when the occasion was pure entertainment.

PARENTHOOD [/head] [p]
Having children so early in their marriage was a mixed blessing.
Diana had felt unwell for much of the early part of her pregnancy, and was not quite herself, which made the process of settling down to married life all the more difficult.
But William was a much loved and much longed-for baby, and the Prince and Princess could not have been happier. [/p] [p]

He had wanted children for years: not having them had been the one drawback to marrying late.

When Simon the Trapper parted from him on the great north ride the Friar loosened the rope that girdled his waist, dragged up his gown a score of inches to free the movement of his lower legs, re-tied his girdle tightly, wiped his hands on the none too clean garment and taking hold of his staff set off up the highway in pursuit of his sack, of Marian, and of the verderers. [pb] [/p] [p]
The Friar was easy-natured and slow to anger.
He was casual, careless and lazy unless roused; when roused he became energetic and tireless until his anger was assuaged.
As his judgement suffered in his calmer moments from overconfidence, so in his energetic ones it suffered from being too headlong.
After the fight with the beggars he had left the sack with Allen and Marian because it had seemed to him an ingenious way of saving himself the trouble of carrying it to Simon's hut and back again while at the same time it was a guarantee that the <head>children</head> would remain until he returned.

Curiously, Gill and Jackson are aware of the problem of identity confusion but believe that it can be avoided if black children are placed transracially when very young: &bquo;it is possible that older black children may, by the time a placement has occurred, have already internalised a definition of themselves as being black and that this definition may jeopardise the possibility of integration and emotional identification within a white family&equo; (p. 138).
The argument seems to be that the world of reality and the concept of self are or should be structured by white parents and society.
Thus children should be placed transracially at a very young age, so becoming &bquo;white in all but skin colour&equo;.
If they already have a concept of themselves as black it will be too late to &bquo;turn them white&equo;.
Bean, writing a year later in 1984, supported this view by saying that &bquo;when the adopted <head>child</head> is an older child who has already acquired a cultural background and a set of cultural responses, these will have to be unlearned if he or she is to acquire a new cultural identity&equo;.

Some concerns the basic methodological pitfalls surrounding any project of this kind &mdash; the lack of proper controls, over-readiness to read richer interpretations into bits of behaviour than a more rigorous viewpoint would endorse, even experimenters' proneness, given their wishful thinking, to be manipulated by their hairy charges into taking up certain attitudes not properly grounded in the available evidence.
Another set of criticisms concerns the basic approach, given the desired object of establishing communicative contact with and among the apes concerned.
Anyone can see that artificial keyboard or lexigram languages can be imparted, if at all, in only the most impoverished social situations &mdash; quite unlike the nexus of warm and intimate physical bonds that probably prevailed at the dawn of language millennia ago.

There is some irony in the fact that many schools are on the one hand educating children about healthy eating and on the other selling at break time nothing less than junk foods such as crisps, chewy fruit sweets and chocolate bars.
The attractions of these products are that they store well, are easily obtained and offer a high profit margin.
Fresh fruit and raw carrots are an alternative and represent healthier eating but they are perishable, less profitable and need some preparation before sale.
The response to the dilemma by a growing number of schools is to completely abandon the sale of food at breaks and to look to other means to generate funds.
The selling of sugar free squash at break times provides a service appreciated by <head>children</head> and also generates a regular income.

Most of the mailers are free, but Denver-based Financial Programs sells,

Stanford when a current first-grader reaches college age, parents would

further reduce the monthly amount if they start saving earlier -- when
mother and child come home from the hospital.  Plugging a cheaper college

Not all the clergy and all the religious orders have been actively engaged in the pursuit of this ideal, but one or two orders have been; for example, the Christian Brothers are devoted to the ideals of a Christian and catholic education, and supporters of the concept of a nation dedicated to God and at the same time distinctly Irish.
In making this comment, one is merely pointing out particular ideological characteristics in hard-working, deeply religious, and committed people.
However, in the practical context of an Ireland divided between two power blocs, such a nationalist form is profoundly ethnic and exclusivist, whatever its believed aims and ideal content.
There is an elective affinity between this cultural vision and the religious vision of the Roman catholic <head>church</head> prior to the second Vatican Council, in its exclusivist attitude towards other Christian churches, an attitude which is far from overcome at the level of popular Roman catholicism.

There are recorded the signatures of those who helped to shape the town: Obyns, Atkinson, Dawson, Paul, Shillington, Workman, Pepper, Overend and others.

In the second half of the eighteenth century, two fresh problems came into the open, particularly through the work of Gotthold Ephraim Lessing (1729&ndash;81).
Lessing was a man of many parts &mdash; writer, literary critic, historian, advocate of religious tolerance &mdash; who also made pioneering contributions to the study of the New Testament, and was from time to time embroiled in the continuing controversies between rationalism and orthodoxy.
It is in that setting that these two problems belong. [/p] [p]
The first was relatively straightforward.
Once the Bible began to be approached as historical material, open to critical historical study, it was natural that the New Testament, and in particular [pb] the life and personality of Jesus himself, should come to be re-examined.
Might not Jesus himself have been rather different from the picture given of him in the gospels and the subsequent teaching of the <head>church</head> ?

In our concern for church growth it is imperative that we discern the relationship between the growth of the Church and the realisation of the Kingdom.
Too close an identification will blind us to the shortcomings of the institutional Church, so that church growth becomes denominational aggrandisement.

Coleridge viewed it rather as another home for Pantisocracy, even though his companions and fellow believers were reduced now to Sara herself and George Burnett.

When the House of Commons considered the matter in 1953, its views were affected by the fact that they were unaware of any evidence of pressure for change from the churches themselves.
It can, however, no longer be assumed that that is so, and in any case it is not clear that if a clergyman wishes to stand and electors wish him to represent them the mere fact that the churches do not like the idea has anything to do with matter.
For the time being, and probably for the foreseeable future, the rather vague criterion remains that of &bquo;episcopal ordination&equo;, vague because that procedure is not peculiar to the Anglican Church.
To attempt to confine the disqualification to &bquo;true&equo; episcopal ordination takes the argument back at least to the Reformation and perhaps to St. Peter.

The church gets its name from the adjacent hospice where pilgrims on their way to or from Rome once stayed.
The hospice was closed in 1770 and pulled down.
The church is noticeable for its dowdy appearance, the barely visible fresco of St Peter in the circle above the door and its general air of being run down.
At one time there were fine frescoes inside by pupils of Giotto, but even these have gone.

There are two reasons: firstly, in the summer of 1990 major work started on the church which could restore it to something like its original form; this would make it interesting, because pilgrim churches are rare.
Secondly, its position, hard up against a modern building, and beside and across from many more, demands attention.
The little <head>church</head> has suffered from the rigours of time and town planning, normally a lethal combination, and survived.

The absence of endowments before the time of the Emperor Constantine inevitably meant that well-to-do Christians had much influence on their local communities, which could be decisive when a new bishop was being chosen.
But care for the poor remained a prime task of bishops.
The Roman empire was no welfare state, and before Christian times in the West (unlike the East) care for the poor was rare.
Poverty is a relative term.
The Latin [hi]pauper [/hi] means a person of modest means rather than someone without food, roof, or clothing; Ovid defined him as &bquo;a man who knows how many sheep he owns&equo;.
The Christians sought to protect the destitute, or those who had fallen in status and resources like widows and orphans.
They provided hospices for the sick or for raising the innumerable foundlings.
In the mid-third century the Roman <head>church</head> was feeding 155 church officials of various grades, and more than 1,500 widows and distressed persons.

Following the passing of the 1689 Toleration Act, which gave Presbyterians, Baptists, Quakers, and other dissenters from the Anglican church the right to worship in public, new nonconformist meeting-houses began to be constructed throughout England.
While these buildings often shared with Wren's London churches a basic classical design, they fundamentally differed from them both in their smaller scale and greater simplicity.
The dissenters who met in these new places of worship belonged to a Puritan tradition which disapproved of the decoration of <head>churches</head> , and the interiors of meeting-houses were thus kept bare and plain.

In Rome Easter was celebrated on the Sunday following the full moon after the spring equinox, and was a memorial of the resurrection.
In the 150s Polycarp of Smyrna visited Rome; no agreement was reached.
In the 190s it seemed intolerable to the then bishop of Rome, Victor, that the churches in Asia Minor celebrated Easter on a different date, and to the distress of many he threatened excommunication on those who did not adopt the Roman date.
Since the churches of Asia Minor in all probability had the more ancient observance, they refused submission, and the difference continued. [/p] [p]
In the mid-third century Bishop Stephen of Rome asserted that all should observe the tradition of Peter and Paul: viz. those baptized outside the <head>church</head> by schismatic clergy should be readmitted as penitents by imposition of hands, but not treated as if the majesty of Christ's name had never been pronounced.

The Rev. Alphonsus Trabold, a theology professor and exorcism expert at St.
Bonaventure University in Olean, N.Y., frequently is asked to exorcise
unruly spirits, and he often obliges.  ``On certain occasions a spirit
could be earthbound and make itself known,'' he says.  ``It happens.''
Father Trabold often uses what he calls ``a therapeutic exorcism'': a few
prayers and an admonition to the spirit to leave.  ``If the person believes
there's an evil spirit, you ask it to be gone,'' he says.  ``The suggestion
itself may do the healing.'' But sometimes more energetic attacks are
required.  To wrestle with a demon in a house owned by a Litchfield, Conn.,
woman, the Warrens recently called in an exorcist, the Rev. Robert McKenna,

I remembered how hard it was for an outsider to become accepted by
long-established, stake-holding residents, and what pitfalls awaited an
original thinker in societies that were long accustomed to unchanging, ``

with five children at home, when my views and actions were deemed
unsettling by a timid, small-town employer.  How difficult it is for a
thinking person to live among societies rooted in the past.  Now, I revel

But internal church documents clearly show that at its publicity-seeking
heights, as when it organized a spectacular Yankee Stadium bicentennial
rally in 1976, there actually were only about 2,000 full-time Unification
Church members in the U.S. Mr. Moon's support for a Watergate-beleaguered
Richard Nixon, the Koreagate scandal, and his prison sentence for
income-tax evasion did not help the church's recruitment efforts.
Defections, burnouts, and abduction ``deprogrammings'' kept member turnover
high.  That the membership number has even kept close to its 1976 size is
the result of the ``graying'' of the church.  Many of the enthusiastic
young ``Moonies'' of the Nixon era who remained faithful to Father Moon are

Initially at any rate, it is best to choose packs that contain the types of component which can be found in practically every project. [/p] [p]
The obvious first buy is a pack of small resistors, such 0.25 watt 5 per cent types.
A pack of around 1000 resistors can be had for well under &pound;10, which is clearly under 1p per resistor.
Even if a few of the resistors are never used, this still represents a very cheap and easy way to buy resistors.
It is the way I obtain most of my resistors incidentally. [/p] [p]
Other types of component which definitely merit the pack treatment are radial electrolytic capacitors, ceramic capacitors, polyester capacitors, and miniature horizontal preset resistors.

Fundamental Filter [/head] [p]
Eliminating the fundamental is not easy.
A distortion of 0.1 per cent means that the harmonic power is 60dB down.

Modern amplifiers may have distortion levels as low as 80dB below fundamental, or even lower.

Researchers built the channel so that it is free of dopants, stopping the charges from bumping into impurity atoms along the way.
Instead, a layer of doped silicon is placed directly underneath the channel.
This dopant layer sets the voltage at which the transistor turns off and on. [/p] [p]
As a result, the mobility of the charges as they travel through the transistor is twice as good as any similar, submicron p-channel mosfet transistor yet built. [/p] [p]
A p-channel transistor, relying on hole mobility, is usually slower than an n-channel device.
The goal is to use the improved p-channel transistor to boost the speed of complementary circuits where both types of transistors work together. [/p] [p]

If the glider is in a very steep climb this should be reduced slightly before yawing.
A common fault is to level out too much, which results in a completely slack cable and makes the winch driver's job of judging the correction quite impossible. [/p] [p]
In turbulent air the launch should be abandoned if the launching speed becomes really excessive.
(Usually this is the pilot's fault for holding the glider down too much during the initial climb, or failing to get right up into the normal angle of climb.)
If a decision is made to abandon the launch at height, it is safer to release first and then to lower the nose, as this prevents the risk of the cable parachute opening and flying up over the aircraft.
Should the latter ever happen, it is best to land ahead regardless rather than attempt a <head>circuit</head> .

However, its advantages will not be fully realised until the recession slows, sales pick up and unit costs fall.
Electronic ballasts can save up to 30 per cent of the energy consumed by a conventional coil-core wire-wound ballast.

The higher frequencies of 25&ndash;35 k.Hz eliminate flickering and stroboscopic effects. [/p] [p]

As is pointed in International Rectifier's note AN-969m power mosfets possess advantages over bipolar transistors for ignition circuits, chiefly because of the high voltages then must withstand when used in place of a conventional mechanical contact breaker.
Power mosfets exhibit no secondary breakdown and can be avalanched to clamp excessive overvoltage due to leakage inductance or a disconnected HT lead.
Also, they need no base drive, being voltage controlled.
The note explains that the series resistance of the mosfet need not lead to inefficiency and a circuit performing at higher efficiency than the one using bipolars is feasible. [/p] [p]
Modern ignition coils are of low inductance with ballast resistors for improved cold starting; inductive discharge <head>circuits</head> , as opposed to the older capacitive discharge types, require the discharge of typically 6A, a bipolar transistor needing safe-operating-area clamps, which increase both cost and dissipation.

Clearly, detecting the opening and closing of the points under static conditions will be somewhat problematic since most ohmmeters will not just be able to detect such a small change in resistance. [/p] [p]
The circuit shown in Fig. 2 (based on a comparator) will, however, detect changes in resistance of less than 0.1 ohm.
The circuit requires a 9V d.c. supply (50mA maximum) and operates an l.e.d. which will provide a visual indication whenever the contact breakers are open.
The threshold sensitivity of the instrument is adjusted by means of VR1.
In order to set this for optimum sensitivity, a one ohm resistor should be connected across the probes and the control is adjusted until the l.e.d. [hi]just [/hi] becomes illuminated.
The resistor can now be removed and the instrument will be ready for use.
If necessary, the <head>circuit</head>of Fig. 2 can be duplicated to permit simultaneous adjustment of both engines on a twin engined aircraft. [/p] [p]

Output voltage offset is trimmable in the usual way by a pot between null pins, although this method does have the slight disadvantage that input offset is affected: 1mV of output offset change alters input offset by about 1&micro;V, also altering output offset drift by 3&micro;V/&deg;C per 1mV.

These seem to have the curious property that, although they can move fairly freely within a hadron, it appears to be impossible to obtain just one quark on its own; they always come either in groups of three (like the proton or neutron) or in pairs consisting of a quark and antiquark (like the pi meson).
To explain this, quarks were endowed with an attribute called color.
It should be emphasized that this has nothing to do with our normal perception of color; quarks are far too small to be seen by visible light.
It is merely a convenient name.
The idea is that quarks come in three colors &mdash; red, green, and blue &mdash;; but that any isolated bound state, such as a hadron, has to be <head>colorless</head> , either a combination of red, green, and blue like the [pb] proton, or a mixture of red and antired, green and antigreen, and blue and antiblue, like the pi meson.

A consequence of the renormalization procedure is that the effective coupling constant of the theory depends on the energy at which it is measured and decreases to zero at very high energies.
This phenomenon is known as asymptotic freedom.
It means that quarks inside a hadron behave almost like free particles in high-energy collisions, so that their perturbations can be treated successfully by perturbation theory.
The predictions of perturbation theory are in reasonable qualitative agreement with observation, but one cannot yet really claim that the theory has been experimentally verified.
At low energies the effective coupling constant becomes very large and perturbation theory breaks down.
It is hoped that this &bquo;infrared slavery&equo; will explain why quarks are always confined in <head>colorless</head> bound states, but so far no one has been able to demonstrate this really convincingly. [/p] [p]

A lot of Earth's creatures, of course, are neither large nor live in tropical climes, and the energy costs of endothermy are not necessarily so high.
Let us look first at insects, which are particularly vulnerable to extremes of temperature.

And at temperatures of 40&deg;C plus, the insect can orient itself parallel to the Sun's rays to reduce the amount of body surface facing the Sun.
It can also lever its legs further off the ground, or it can climb vegetation to reduce thermal ground conductivity. [/p] [p]
At the same time it can exploit the low thermal conductivity of the air; i.e. the way the temperature of the air itself is neither as hot nor as <head>cool</head>as the land surface.

Trim off their leaves, and then spread the roots between layers of moist sand or dry sawdust, placing the largest roots at the bottom as these keep longest.
Beetroot is always better stored in this way after its leaves have been twisted off.
You should never wash roots before storing, but always gently rub off any loose soil. [/p] [p]
Apples should be picked carefully and graded so that the smallest and largest are used first, and medium-sized fruit is saved for storage.
Lay the fruit stem uppermost on shelves or in shallow boxes so that they do not touch each other.
Wrap the finest dessert specimens individually, in some newspaper.
Alternatively, store them in perforated polythene bags. [/p] [p]

More generally, Roach has reservations about the direction the music took after bebop &mdash; &bquo;There was a change-over: it went into dance and party music, functioning as an entertaining vehicle rather than an intellectual, enlightening thing&equo; &mdash; and he sees the effects of this slackening of purpose in the playing of a number of later-1980s musicians.
Roach is a busy man: as well as continuing work with his quartet (currently touring the UK), his double quartet, a percussion ensemble known as M'Boom and a forthcoming collaboration on a play about the Harlem Renaissance, he's also involved with New York rappers in a project called From Bebop to Hiphop and Then There's Max.

Timing is critical: many meetings are marred by going on and on.
Your audience must know that you finished on time, without knowing [hi]how [/hi] you did it.
Plan the schedule as a whole, and in detail, and write down exact timings.
Always finish on time, unless there is a very good reason to overrun.
Be flexible with the details so that if you are getting behind you can trim the programme.
Brief your participants that you will be conducting the meeting this way and expect their co-operation.
Leave them wanting more is a good piece of showbusiness advice.
If people leave feeling it was good but rather long, you have failed.
If they leave wishing it had gone on longer, you've succeeded. [/p] [p]
If you are actually conducting a meeting, do it with sensitivity, objectivity, a <head>cool</head>head and an informal personal touch.

There was the pond that lay, dark and mysterious, along the lower road to Lulling Woods, mirroring the trees that stood around it.
Sometimes in the summer Paul had taken a bright wooden boat on a string and floated it there, beating at the water's edge with a fan of leaves to make waves.
In the spring, vast masses of frogs' spawn floated just beneath the surface, like submerged chain-mail cast there by some passing knight.
And on one day of hard frost, Paul and Molly had slid back and forth across the shining ice, screaming with delight, watched by a bold robin who sat fearlessly nearby on a low bare branch preening the pale grey feathers that edged the bronze of his breast. [pb] [/p] [p]
