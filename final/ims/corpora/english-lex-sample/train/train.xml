Their multiscreen projections of slides and film loops have featured in orbital parties, at the Astoria and Heaven, in Rifat Ozbek's 1988/89 fashion shows, and at Energy's recent Docklands all-dayer.
From their residency at the Fridge during the first summer of love, Halo used slide and film projectors to throw up a collage of op-art patterns, film loops of dancers like E-Boy and Wumni, and unique fractals derived from video feedback.
&bquo;We're not aware of creating a visual identify for the house scene, because we're right in there.

Leeds is well-equipped for sports, with 21 golf courses and 22 sports and leisure centres, but if all this action leaves you feeling in need of a rest, you can always take yourself off to the theatre.
Leeds has four to choose from.
Most famous is the Leeds City Varieties, one of the oldest music halls in the country and home of BBC TV's [hi]The Good Old Days [/hi].
There's also the Grand Theatre, which hosts touring companies and is the permanent home of Opera North. [/p] [p]

In this perspective it seems that Callinicos can only mean relatively little with his disclaimers about good art.
The individual &bquo;good&equo; work might get thrown up, however unpropitious the circumstance.
But it can only be a quirk; and the force of its &bquo;goodness&equo; is strictly limited and circumscribed.
Only once, in a fleeting reference to Matisse is there a sense of the boot being on the other foot, of art offering a sense of liberation from social ideology.
But even this is done in the name of a supposed &bquo;immediate sensuous charge&equo; rather than any more extended critical capacity of <head>art</head>or the aesthetic.

The Chairman of the Chambre Nationale, Yannick Guilloux, said the charges brought against Britain must not be seen as the stand of one European country against another but a bid to harmonise tax regulation, at as low a rate as possible, in order to protect the art market within the EC as a whole.
The Commission normally takes two months to investigate charges, after which it could either instruct Britain to set its VAT rates in conformity with European legislation or proceed to put into effect the long awaited 7th Directive on fiscal matters.
A meeting of Ministers last month was once again unable to reach agreement on VAT. [/p] [/div2] [div2] [head]

Many writers interested in these phenomena tend to specialise either in child play or in the arts, the former finding clues in the activity which relate to child development, the latter establishing art as an enhancement of what is good and beautiful.
Narrowing the field to either one or the other of these, has sometimes trapped the theoreticians into claiming that they have identified a defining characteristic of their field.
For instance, Arnaud Reid (1982), in arguing that what all the variety of art forms have in common is the requirement of &bquo;aesthetic intention&equo;, explains: [quote] [p]
For &mdash; cutting straight through the recurring controversies about whether, because of the varieties of the arts and of the infinity of differences between different individual works, &bquo;art&equo; can be &bquo;defined&equo; &mdash; one thing, I think, is clear.
There is something common to all our experiences of <head>art</head> , of whatever kind &mdash; music, poetry, painting&hellip;, each art concretely utterly different from the others.

Yet Modigliani was too much a part of the life of Montparnasse, too involved with the individuals leading the &bquo;new art&equo;, to remain completely aloof.
In 1914 he had met Hans Arp, the French painter who was to become prominent in the new Dada movement, at the artists' canteen in the Avenue du Maine.
Two years later Arp was living in Zurich, a member of a group of talented &eacute;migr&eacute; artists who had left their own countries because of the war.
Through casual meetings at caf&eacute;s, the artists drew together to form a movement in protest against the waste of war, against nationalism and against everything pompous, conventional or boring in the <head>art</head>of the Western world.

For her latest exhibition, Oulton has gone even further to distance herself from Old Master traditions and concepts of Englishness.
Out have gone the autumnal shades, in have come bold contrasts of saturated reds and greens.
Where before Oulton teased her interpreters with titles such as &bquo;Lachrimae&equo; and &bquo;Vanitas&equo;, her new paintings have sterner names such as &bquo;Transparence No 7&equo;. [/p] [p]
We can now see that Oulton's art has followed a wilfully individual path, avoiding too close an association with any fashionable cause, and managing to remain relevant in a trecherous time.
She may well have a thing or two to teach the Goldsmiths' graduates about handling the demands of the <head>art</head>world and media. [/p] [p]

But the pervasive and insidious presence throughout the novel of manifestations of Quechua culture suggests the ability of that culture not only to survive in an alien environment, but also, as it itself is modified, to exercise an &bquo;Indianizing&equo; influence on the country as a whole.
However, such works do not merely show the dominant culture being resisted and subverted by popular culture; in their form, they themselves have been influenced by the culture which they depict.
[hi]The Fox Above and the Fox Below [/hi], for example, is structured on Andean organizing principles and develops a style of &bquo;oral writing&equo; that transposes popular Quechua <head>art</head>forms to the printed page, and Rowe notes &bquo;the compositional impact of popular oral culture in Garc&iacute;a M&aacute;rquez, that of Guarani culture in Roa Bastos, and of middle-American culture in Asturias&equo; (Rowe 1984: 85).

Academies of art, whether in the West or in the Orient, have had lists of priorities in themes of art, in which there are many similarities.
For example, in twelfth-century China, a catalogue of the Imperial collection had ten headings: Taoist and Buddhist subjects, human affairs, palaces and other buildings, foreign tribes, dragons and fishes, landscapes, animals, flowers and birds, ink bamboos, and finally vegetables and fruit.
This sort of listing is worth knowing by a reader, who may occasionally notice that it underlies the degree of attention being paid to a theme by a critic. [/p] [/div2] [div2] [head]
THE SURVEY WITH A THEORY [/head] [p]

Self-contradiction is natural in the human make-up; inconsistencies are not worrying in themselves, so long as they aren't planted by memoir-writers or biographers putting down other biographers.
The personality contradictions have in no way been ironed out; if anything they emerge more starkly.

The contradictions fall into something like a natural order of things, in a flamboyant era when the natural was notalways easy to come by.

In practice, all media do have a limited life.

Michael Edwards, taking a paradoxical approach, has argued that the English have always been strong on literary theory, instancing a distinguished succession of poet-critics: Sidney, Dryden, Johnson, Wordsworth, Coleridge, Shelley, Arnold, Eliot.
Most of their important critical texts, Edwards remarks, are theoretical, in that they prompt fundamental reflections about the basic nature of writing, even if, &bquo;One notices about such writing that it does not necessarily offer itself as theory, that it is directed towards what we now call literature and not towards something else.&equo;
[pb] Edward's comment is clearly correct, and could be extended: Hopkins's letters and notebooks, for instance, contain a weight of original theorizing that is more substantial and more interesting than much recent writing.
But present-day theorists are likely to be dismissive of what has been called &bquo;writers' speculation about their <head>art</head> &equo;, finding it impressionistic and unsystematic.

The SI thus rejected &bquo;mechanical becoming, with its notions of progress, merit and causal succession&equo;.
This statement reflects the resistance of the SI to piecemeal historicism out of which lineages are made, but in Levin's history the independent achievements of Debord as a film-maker eventually collapses into it.
In fairness it has to be said that Levin tries to isolate Debord from a purely formal Modernism, and from naive realism (the politics of the signified).
He does this by proclaiming, a &bquo;third avant-garde&equo;, which avoids the major pitfalls (of the &bquo;two avant-gardes') and secures some theoretical authority for Debord.
However, because this is not adequately related to the political ideals of the SI there is no analysis of the projected [pb] means (theoretical or practical) by which the sublation of <head>art</head>in the praxis of life might be achieved. [/p] [p]

However, collaboration with Apple in 1986 in the publication of a daily newspaper for the athletes' village at the Commonwealth Games, held that year in Edinburgh, resulted in the acquisition of several Apple Macintoshes and a laser printer.
It also resulted in the interest in the potential of the Macintosh extending beyond the production area to design and editorial staff where it developed into passionate enthusiasm.
Adoption of the Macintosh as the basic tool within the teaching of all aspects of publishing followed rapidly because of: [list] [item]

Before 1914, war propaganda had not been traditionally a British trait and the authorities leaned to use it following the examples of the French and Germans.
For this purpose, new institutions were created, such as the Ministry for Information and the War Museum, and special administrative officers appointed, like John Buchan and Lord Rothermere in the First World War, Sir Kenneth Clark in the Second.
They were responsible for appointing war artists.
Prominent in artist-ministry public relations was the etcher Muirhead Bone, who was also the first British War Artist, serving as such in both World Wars.
Himself a traditional artist, he recommended a variety of colleagues of widely differing styles, including Epstein and Stanley Spencer.
Continuing this tradition, Kenneth Clark selected artists of individual vision for these rather establishmentarian posts, stressing the importance of their work as <head>art</head> . [/p] [p]

The daring magnitude of this conception has since been obscured by its almost routine enactment in a series of African countries in the 1960s, but it should never be forgotten that India was the test case, and that at the time success in the execution of such a plan seemed far from assured: only a year before Mountbatten's appointment the then viceroy, Lord Wavell, had been pressing on the Cabinet his &bquo;Breakdown Plan&equo;, which consisted simply of the phased evacuation of the British from India without any serious attempt to ensure that a viable, much less friendly, government was installed in their place.
&bquo;That would indeed&equo;, Attlee told the Cabinet, &bquo;be an inglorious end to our long association with India&equo;, and he set his face firmly against such a course.
Instead, he gambled on finding someone who could play the last card in the British deck &mdash; independence &mdash; and then, with nothing further to offer, keep sufficient control of the situation to extricate Britain from India with honour and possibly with glory.

Editions Aldines have just published Jacopo da Pontormo (FFr680 until 31 January and FFr750 thereafter).
As well as a facsimile of the Mannerist painter's diary, it contains three texts by Jean-Claude Lebensztejn: a commentary, an analysis of his life as seen by Vasari, and a long essay on the Santa Felicit&aacute; &bquo;Deposition&equo;.
Another book by the same publisher/author team, though covering a completely different period, is due to appear in June 1993.

When the historian Asa Briggs examined their backgrounds he found that fifty-six of them had been university educated, forty at Oxford or Cambridge.
The three schools of Eton, Harrow and Winchester accounted for twenty governors.
Among the thirty-eight who had been politically active, there were more than twice as many Conservatives as anything else &mdash; nineteen were Tories, seven Liberal and eight Labour.
Their average age on taking up their post was fifty-four.
Although appointed to represent a cross-section of British life &mdash; one each from Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland; at least one academic; one trade unionist (almost always from the right-wing of the movement); one with an interest in the <head>arts</head> ; usually a scientist; a retired diplomat to represent the Foreign Office; and in recent years one representative from the ethnic minorities &mdash; they have their amateurism in common.

Blamey worked in oils, and his basic palette consists of titanium white, yellow ochre, burnt sienna, Indian red, cadmium red, cadmium yellow, ultramarine, occasionally cerulean, viridian blue black (a favourite colour) and occasionally alizarin crimson.

On the telecommunications side, research is being carried out into high bandwidths that require high repetition pulses &mdash; a rate of 200GHz has been achieved and into Erbium-doped fibre amplifiers, which are a key component for future optical networks.
And, finally, work is continuing into the fabrication of fibres.
The researchers at Southampton use variants of the Modified Chemical Vapour deposition technique that was developed mainly in-house to produce a number of different types of fibres such as polarising, helical core and twin core, along with a range of single and multimode silica fibres for telecommunications, sensing and medical applications.
The University also says that it can supply state-of-the <head>art</head>fibre to other universities and industry across the world in accordance with specific designs, if required.

The underlying question for a reader of criticism is what influences are exerted on the critic; but as in this instance, for long it may be impossible to know the truth. [/p] [p]
One noticeable feature of American art life is the link between art historical teaching and criticism, not so common elsewhere.
The practice of American art historians reviewing or curating exhibitions, not only historical shows, is a normal feature of art life.
Part of the reason for this is that the American professoriat is the largest in the world, while the American market for current art is unprecedented; it is evident that the turnover of the American art market as a whole is the largest in the world.
The persuasive tax advantages for the rich to contribute works of <head>art</head>to public collections also play a part, contributing a measure of prestige shared between artists and the powerful in society.

If this exhibition means to report on the whole of twentieth-century American modernism then it has left out a great deal in the period between the two world wars; work that is historically important and good even though sometimes &bquo;provincial&equo; with respect to Europe.
With the exception of Ad Reinhardt there is no one who was involved in &bquo;pure&equo; or hard-edge abstraction in the Thirties; except for Hopper and Sheeler there is no realism before (or after) World War II; and there is no nod to Depression-era painting.
Massive chunks of history are missing and it is really not possible to understand the Abstract Expressionists without reference to how they incorporated or reacted against those earlier tendencies. [/p] [p]

Then there was the freedom of the Voice of America, the freedom of the Free World.
By 1948 the US needed an international cultural prestige to offset its military and political power: it needed a sophisticated reply to the slogans of Yankee Go Home!
This is why the CIA during the 50s and 60s covertly supported a multitude of initiatives whose aim was to present the new American Art across the world as a promise for the future.

As the name implies, dendrochronology is specific to the dating of wood.
This technique is highly precise, to the year or even season of felling, if the sample is adequate.
Herein lies the problem: the wood needs to be of a [pb] species for which there is a &bquo;master chronology&equo; (see p. 125) and there must normally be at least a hundred tree rings in the sample to be dated to ensure a unique match with the master pattern.
If the date is to be precise to the year of felling, the bark must also be present, otherwise an estimate must be made of the number of missing rings corresponding to likely wastage by the carpenter.
Furthermore, to determine the date of actual usage, allowance must be made for seasoning of the timber. [/p] [p]
Dendrochronology is most commonly used in the <head>art</head>world to test the authenticity of panel paintings.

From high ground in the vicinity of the farm, there is a wide prospect of rolling moorlands backed by Gragareth across the shallow trench of Ease Gill: it is a desolate landscape, a wilderness devoid of trees and habitations and without any promise of beauty.
Most urban visitors will flee the scene and never return.
But appearances deceive.
This vast expanse of grass and heather is a cover concealing a realm of magic and mystery, where since the beginning of time nature has been at work slowly evolving an intricate subterranean labyrinth of caverns, grottoes and canals carved in beautiful designs by the agency of running water. [/p] [p]
This hidden wonderland, sculptured in darkness absolute, remained unseen and unsuspected through the ages until the present century when men first ventured into rifts in the ground and beheld in the light of torches an amazing display of sculptured limestone in patterns both incredibly delicate and massive, a living museum of <head>art</head>in many forms.

He is, of course, much more than the most prodigious goalkicker the international game has seen or is likely to see, given the reduction in the number of penalty offences.

He will by only 31 come the next World Cup. [/p] [p]

Some writing by artists takes the form of instruction; in every period manuals on how to do it, whether drawing, making sculpture or other technical tasks are found, though their incidence is irregular, and such treatises are often the work of minor artists, rather than the great; Leonardo is an exception. [/p] [p]
Teachers of art are more likely to write books of instruction, and in their efforts to educate their students may make comments about the traditions they admire and from which they hope their students will learn.
One lesson for practical students is to analyse works.
A teacher's list for analysing pictures may be something like that of the American educationalist Thomas Munro: first impressions of the picture as a whole, line, light and dark, colour, mass, space, unity of design.
Books on <head>art</head>appreciation will also concern themselves with formal questions, as they have done since the beginning of the century.

All of this, and no mention of money or material resources!!
Our partnership has never been aimed at a resourcing of the school in a material sense, but has focused on the educational experiences of students and their provision at the highest quality possible.
Many of our partners work in industries where finance and resources are as hard to come by as they are in education.
This does not mean that such support is not available or forthcoming for genuine development.
Our work-experiences booklet is sponsored, materials for Technology and improvement of the school's environment have been supplied.
Sponsorship of an <head>Arts</head>Week and Events Week enabled both to take place, and the donation of physical resources is gratefully received.

The critique of Nietzsche's apocalyptic aestheticism, with its injunction to build your dwelling on the slopes of Vesuvius, just cannot be reduced to the clich&eacute; about Baudrillard fiddling while Rome burns with which the book closes.
(Is it anyway such a bad thing to make music while Atlantis sinks and cities evaporate?
At least you would have to be a doctor to say so, and not a politician or an academic.)
A requirement to minimise, even to trivialise the aesthetic &mdash; one might almost say, a fear of the aesthetic &mdash; is the hollowness at the heart of historical materialism as it is defended here. [/p] [p]
There is obviously a problem concerning the subjective dimension of the aesthetic.

The difficulties of the new professionally conscious architects of that time, when facing the judgement of enlightened amateurs, became a recurring situation during the campaign for new Government Offices.
The complexity of nineteenth-century building meant that increasing numbers of men had to devote their lives to its study, by making architecture their livelihood.
By establishing among themselves standards of attainment and behaviour, these largely middle-class experts aimed to seek social acceptability as professionals with a corporate identity. [/p] [p]
The first attempt to organize a professional body occurred in 1831, when the Architects Society was formed.
Until that time the Royal Academy of <head>Arts</head> , which was founded in 1768, was the only body in England with a substantial representation of architects among its membership, although they were always out-numbered by painters and sculptors.

He absorbed European culture through nineteenth-century French novels, and through the literature of sixteenth and seventeenth-century Spain, the Spanish cultural Golden Age.
His major literary enterprise, as a student at the Universidad Nacional Aut&oacute;noma in 1951, was the invention of a bad Golden Age poet whom he named Tiburcio Esquirla.
His later artistic inventions display the same fascination with the possibilities of getting inside the skin of another era.
Through his efforts in this direction he effectively mocks much that is dear to scholars, historians, literary critics and <head>art</head>historians, especially the concept of a clear chronological sequence: his answer to the problem of how a Mexican can &bquo;belong&equo; to the dynasty of European art is, as it were, to invade it retrospectively.

In short, Eliot has delineated a critic who recognizes public or civic responsibilities; and unless we are very careful, to say of this critic that he &bquo;serves his art&equo; may seem a rather sudden cramping and diminution of the claims made for him.
The same thing happens when, later in the essay, Eliot defines the limitation of Pound's kind of criticism (for &bquo;any kind of criticism has its limitations&equo;): &bquo;The limitation of Pound's kind is in its concentration upon the craft of letters, and of poetry especially&equo;.
To move from &bquo;<head>art</head> &equo; to &bquo;craft&equo; is rather plainly a further contraction, or diminution: and it will be radically misunderstood unless we remember that for Pound the level of craftsmanship (not just in letters, but in supposedly humbler trades also) is a register, a thermometer-reading, of the good or ill health of a period or of a society.

Saatchi, the most spectacular collector of recent times and probably the most active collector in British history (with the exception of King Charles I), had bought their work in greater bulk and more intelligently than any other individual or institution.
Now, as one New York dealer put it a week ago, &bquo;the word is that he's cashing in.&equo; [/p] [p]

In 1980 the National Heritage Memorial Fund (NHMF) was put on an independent footing, with what was then a large sum to spend on Britain's art and heritage.
All went well until 1985, when museum purchase grants were frozen at the level at which they have remained, the reasoning being that for anything really important, they could go to the NHMF.
This meant that museums not only became progressively poorer, but also less in control of their purchasing policies.
Then, only two months ago, Peter Brooke himself announced that they were to have no purchase grants as such, but that these were now merged with the vote which pays for running expenses.
The theory is that if museums save on salaries and paper clips they will have more money to spend on works of <head>art</head> ; the reality is that they will almost certainly be saving on the works of art to make up for inadequate funding overall.

Alfred Barr, the first director of the Museum of Modern Art, New York, is exemplary.
In 1936, for example, the Museum put on two crucially important exhibitions, on [hi]Cubist and Abstract Art [/hi], and [hi]Fantastic Art, Dada, Surrealism [/hi].
For the latter catalogue Barr chose the Surrealist writer Georges Hugnet to write a historical essay, but it was Barr's intelligent advocacy and choice of works that made the show such a significant affair.
In place of the aggressive approach of the early years of Surrealism itself, Barr's commentary is in moderated phrases pointing to similarities between Surrealism and works firmly within the tradition of Western <head>art</head> : [quote] [p]

Many subsequent critics have taken up the point made by radical blacks at the time that this was a romantic and pastoral view of the rural South, but several early critics hailed the film as a brilliantly realistic depiction of a whole section of American society.
Welford Beaton thought that its examination of the progress of cotton from field to factory would be of great educational value and he urged distributors to put the film into every motion-picture theatre in the world.

There is a vigorous defence of Coleman by Mayer: &bquo;The energies of Coleman's mind were more exclusively devoted to anything bearing upon the horse: and no wonder, for the College, constructed as it was and is, can only be adapted for the reception of that animal.
Consequently, it alone, of all our domesticated animals, has absorbed the whole attention, until very lately, of the professors of that establishment.
In Mr Coleman's early career, and even until within a very few years, the veterinary art, so far as regards its application to cattle, sheep, swine, dogs, etc., was in the lowest state of barbarism and degradation.

The world's great love of the panda could be causing a lot of the damage.
Instead of dealing with the problem of a shrinking environment, for many years, scientists have wanted to protect the panda by taking them away and intervening with modern and more effective methods.
However, there has been very little success with captive breeding and few of the cubs which are born survive past the first year. [/p] [p]
Now at last attention has been turned to the real problem.
The Chinese government is looking at ways to protect the panda's home from further destruction.
One can only hope that we, as the panda's worst enemy, can somehow right our wrongs and have finally learnt how much we have to lose. [/p] [div2] [head]

When he has tovarisch say, &bquo;Nothing I build&equo;, this is to be understood not allegorically but literally: working of stone, either architecturally or sculpturally, was for Pound the register of culture &mdash; a conviction which he shared in his lifetime with few except the British art-critic whom he knew and esteemed, Adrian Stokes.
Thus the reference to the ruined walls of Eblis, in Aquitaine, is not gratuitous; and we know from other passages that Pound's refusal in the last resort to take seriously Russia's contribution to European culture was grounded in his notion that Russia had never produced an indigenous tradition of stone architecture.
On the other hand, when in the ruined court of Eblis the bees find &bquo;wild grass for their pleasure&equo;, that is good too.
For human building (<head>art</head> ) and the processes of germination (nature) are not in this vision opposed, as alternatives we must choose between.

The authorities may acquire any work of art that someone wants to export.
In such a case, the State will pay the owner the value he has established himself and presented to the Federal National Heritage Service or Custom Officers.
As an owner will have been interested in keeping the value low so as not to pay a high export premium, the State will be ideally placed to acquire valuable works of art on the cheap.
Nor will the State be forced to pay at once.
Payment can be postponed for a year and it is not clear yet how inflation will be taken into account and whether the price will be paid in roubles or in hard currency.

Such religious/humanitarian subject-matter &mdash; even the Holocaust, Hiroshima and Aids have not escaped &mdash; makes a fortress as unassailable by criticism as the art produced under tyranny.
The worth of individual pieces is, obviously, very various; consistent is the appeal to piety, ensuring that the elevated theme produces a warm-hearted response.
These composers are not coldly exploiting their audiences' kindness; they are all equally the victims of the going ideology.
And sincerity is not in question.

THE SOPHISTICATED Miss Gertrude Jekyll, gardening heroine of the Edwardians, commissioned Edwin Lutyens to design her Surrey homestead, and this he did so beautifully that their relationship was cemented and many future joint commissions ensued.
The house was built by Thomas Underwood of Dunsfold, and the stonemason was William Herbert of Whitley.
The garden front, of Bargate stone, brick and tile, shows how Lutyens has exaggerated the local Surrey style to perfectly fitting proportions.
The roof lines swoop, the chimneys soar, and the beams of local oak in the hall look silver with age.
(This effect was achieved by spreading the timbers with hot lime for fifteen minutes and then scraping it off.)
Miss Jekyll's desire (with a little help) for all that was &bquo;thorough and honest of spirit of the good work of old days&equo;, the creed of the <head>Arts</head>and Crafts Movement, was fulfilled.

It was this aspect of Leavisism that Oxford English, with its broad though often flaccid eclecticism, was most opposed to. [/p] [p]
Venturing to propound a law of intellectual life, I suggest that evaluative criticism enters institutional literary study under the influence of practising writers, or of critics who have a close discipular relation to them, but that in time it is rejected, like an alien organ.
Writers, whose criticism arises directly from the problems and possibilities of their <head>art</head> , are inevitably evaluative; Baudelaire showed how being a poet also involves being a critic.

&bquo;American art in the twentieth century&equo;, the fourth in a series of exhibitions which attempt to define national schools of modern and contemporary art, opens in Berlin next month.
Since 1985 Rosenthal has surveyed German, British and Italian art.
In this new show, he has shared curatorial responsibility with his old partner Christos Joachimides with whom he also worked on the German art show (1987, London and Stuttgart), and earlier, &bquo;A New Spirit in Painting&equo; (1980&ndash;81, Berlin and London).
The latter managed to sense the way the wind was to blow during the Eighties by anticipating the various forms of emerging Neo-Expressionism.
Their &bquo;Metropolis&equo; of 1991 on the other hand, also in Berlin, is generally thought not have succeeded in pointing the way for the decade, probably because the <head>art</head>scene is much more fragmented now and no single trend can be identified. [/p] [p]

Furthermore article 939 of the Swiss civil code provides that if the purchaser is in bad faith, based on the test summarised above, the dispossessed owner can claim back his [corr] property [/corr] without any limitation in time. [/p] [p]
These comments do not intend to defend the idea that the existing rules cannot be improved (or that the Sevso case involved stolen goods), but merely that Swiss law should not be used as a &bquo;scapegoat&equo; in this field.

Modigliani was in sympathy with the broad sentiments of the movement, the internationalism, the disgust at the war and those who profited from it, and the sensitivity to the new possibilities in art, although the emphasis on abstract art did not fit into his creed.
But at the time of the launch of Dada, Modigliani was not clear about the meaning of the new movement and no one else seemed to know.
&bquo;With psychological astuteness, the Dadaists spoke of energy and will and assured the world that they had amazing plans.
But concerning the nature of these plans, no information was forthcoming.&equo;

A significant aspect of her work is that it always broaches the boundaries between the traditional disciplines of philosophy, psychoanalysis, literary, and <head>art</head>theory; the implications it holds for each are touched on by the essays in this collection (for instance, Ainley, &bquo;The Ethics of Sexual Difference&equo;; O'Connor, &bquo;The An-Arche of Psychotherapy&equo;; Minow-Pinkney, &bquo;Virginia Woolf: &bquo;Seen from a Foreign Land'&equo;; and Burgin, &bquo;Geometry and Abjection&equo;).

In some ways sculptors became more adventurous, creating figures of larger scale and with more expansive poses than would have been tried in the first century.
But the delicacy of small-scale work, and the demands upon skill made by the need to join exactly the pieced works of the early Empire were diminished. [/p] [p]
The passion for Greece was by no means restricted to wealthy art collectors, antiquarians and professors of rhetoric.
The Roman Empire was itself more acceptable to provincial subjects than had been the case in the age of Augustus, and the emperor's taste for Greek art, well publicised by Hadrian's zest for provincial travel, therefore enjoyed wide support.
The broadly based Hadrianic Greek revival thus proved long lasting, and exerted a profound influence on the <head>art</head>of later antiquity.

The museum has treated this material in thematic fashion, reserving a concluding gallery for &bquo;The Green Room&equo; series of paintings (1907), that bitter cycle of love and jealousy which was intended to evoke the mood of a brothel in Berlin.
In mounting this exhibition, the National Gallery is correcting a bias which it perceives in the content and popularity of the British collections and continuing its reassessment of Northern European art, already apparent from its recent acquisitions policy. [/p] [p]

masters as it strove to build its U.S. business.  European dealers
continued to dominate the action in old masters, which Sotheby's North
America had lately been touting in this country.  For several months, there
was optimism all around.  Last October, Mr. Paul paid out $12 million of

Man as Mars.'' The painting, attributed to Flemish artist Peter Paul Rubens,

With funds of 5.56 billion Hong Kong dollars (US$ 712 million), the new
company, Yaohan International Co., plans to acquire 10 of Hong Kong's top
restaurants.  It also intends to set up an international wholesale market
with the Singapore government next May and to open a department store in
Bangkok and shopping centers in Malaysia, Taiwan, Canada, Chicago and
Seattle by December 1990.  The chain currently has 90 retail outlets in
Japan, seven in the U.S., three in Hong Kong and a dozen more scattered
around the globe.  Major European auction houses are turning increasingly

Symbolist <head>art</head> while Sotheby's is luring collectors with
sales of Swiss, German, Spanish, Australian and Canadian paintings.

The Dorrance family will still receive a substantial portion of the auction
proceeds above $100 million, people familiar with the transaction said.
But it's likely that Sotheby's will take a higher than usual commission,
called an override, on the amount exceeding the guarantee.  Sotheby's has
been aggressively promoting the Dorrance sale.  At a news conference last
May announcing plans for the auction, Sotheby's estimated its value in
excess of $100 million.  More recently, Sotheby's has predicted the
collection will fetch $140 million.  That's the highest estimate for a
single collection in auction history.  The decision to put the entire
collection on the block stunned many, since Mr. Dorrance had served as

care about Said or the ``hypocrites'' he hunts.  ``The Thief and the Dogs''
is a pioneering work, the first stream-of-consciousness novel in Arabic,
but it is likely to disappoint Western readers.  The 1981 novel ``Wedding
Song'' also is experimental, and another badly aimed bullet.  The story of
a playwright's stage debut unfolds in first-person monologues, in the

among all members of the society, reverence for education and creative

Salomon Brothers Inc., the investment-banking firm, in its annual tally of
investment returns, reported that old masters appreciated 51 % in the year
ended June 1, the greatest return of any of 13 assets it tracked.  (
Impressionist and modern paintings, not tracked by Salomon, are ranked even
higher at 74 % by Sotheby's.) Salomon, moreover, gets its data on art
appreciation from Sotheby's, whose prices go up with clients like Mr. Paul
in its thrall.  The percentages omit from consideration the many paintings
that go begging at auction.  Art indexes track winners, not losers.  But
<head>art</head> that has fallen sharply in value is rarely put up
for sale.

As long as a decade ago, Mrs. Thatcher declared she did n't want debate in
her cabinet; she wanted strong government.  Over the weekend, she said she

Nonsense,'' she told an interviewer yesterday on London Weekend Television.

At last night's sale, 13 of 44 works that sold were purchased by Aska
International Gallery, the art-acquisition unit of Aichi Financial, a
Japanese conglomerate that owns 7.5 % of Christie's.  Meanwhile, Sotheby's
guarantee is raising eyebrows in the art world.  ``The consumer has to
throw out the idea that the auction house is a disinterested middleman,''
says New York art dealer David Tunick.  While he adds that he has no
problem with auction houses who sell works in which they have a financial
interest, ``It ought not to be hidden in some small print.'' In such
situations, he says, the house ``is going to put the best light on things.''
For example, an auction house's comments on the condition of a work of
<head>art</head> that is up for sale should be looked at with ``very
open eyes,'' he says.

For example, the managers in most authorities trust their clinical staff to be applying the most appropriate treatment technologies, either in their day-to-day practice, or in submitting bids for the development of clinical services.
The extent to which this trust is misplaced is unknown.
Managers mainly comfort themselves in the knowledge that physical and financial resources for clinical work are in short supply in the NHS.
This is therefore likely to encourage clinicians to search for more cost-effective procedures.
However, it is known from the research into performance indicators that clinical teams with similar levels of resources produce different amounts of services (Yates &amp; Davidge, 1984).
Also it is conceivable that cash limits, whilst being effective in capping overall expenditure, may militate against the adoption of new, cost-effective, procedures if these necessitate financial outlays. [/p] [p]

Secondly, on the broader ground that the legislature could not have intended to give power to a court of summary jurisdiction to control nuisances from such works. [pb] [/p] [p]

Nevertheless, Anselm believed it to be well founded, and he certainly went further than Lanfranc, and was stiffer than Rufus and Henry I, in refusing to acknowledge any papal legate other than himself in England. [/p] [p]
I have already mentioned Anselm's firm refusal to confer about the discipline of the English Church with the papal legate who brought his pallium.
On that occasion he had a special reason &mdash; though an odd one &mdash; for his refusal: he was fully occupied with the duty of defence which had been entrusted to him by the king.
Nevertheless, he also clearly implied that it was none of the legate's business.
Beyond the immediate circumstances of this case, Anselm rejected, so far as England was concerned, the recent papal [pb] practice of entrusting to specially appointed legates large areas within which they had <head>authority</head>over all archbishops and bishops.

These studies show us that many of the families who successfully parent hard to place children are not conventional, middle-class, two-child families.
They sometimes have unusual parenting styles and some, though by no means all, find that having a social worker looking over their shoulder makes them feel uncomfortable and unnecessarily unsure of themselves.
It is up to social workers and the legal system to find ways of supporting rather than hindering parents and children in the difficult task of building themselves into a new family.
This does, I believe, mean that a rethink is urgently needed about the boarding-out regulations, reviews and some other aspects of social work practice, which are appropriate to social work with permanent new families.

The procedural consequence of the doctrine of corporate legal personality is that the proper plaintiff in any action against the directors for breach of their duties is the company, not individual shareholders.
This raises very complicated questions, as yet not fully resolved by the courts, as to the extent to which a director who holds shares may take off his director's hat and attempt to ratify as a shareholder his own alleged misconduct.

Turning to the relevance of consent to the obligation to obey the law, we will here be concerned not with the well-known problem that most citizens in any given society have not consented to the authority of their government, but with the prior question whether their consent, if given, would have been valid.
The main lesson of the discussion of the previous section is that judgment on the validity of consent has to be discriminating.
Consent may be valid in certain contexts or subject to certain conditions and invalid in other contexts and or when the conditions are not met.
From the fact that in some circumstances consent is valid, it does not follow that consent to the government's authority is valid.
One has to examine closely what arguments can establish the validity of such consent. [/p] [p]
Doubts about the validity of consent to political <head>authority</head>are sometimes expressed on the ground that citizens have no choice but to consent.

The careful exegete, however, will also be troubled by the fact that the Bible hardly majors on this issue, that we do not know the context of Paul's two references to the subject, and that a strong anti-homosexual line is only possible if one has already assumed that such statements are immediately transferable into our situation straight from the biblical period.

Second, [hi]divorce and remarriage [/hi].
The New Testament is hardly unequivocal on this matter.
Mark, the earliest Gospel, makes it sound as if Jesus does not allow divorce under any circumstance; but Matthew modifies it to allow that some circumstances may make remarriage legitimate.
Paul in 1 Corinthians 7 seems to put another slant on this from the perspective of Roman life in the first century. [/p] [p]

Otto turned out to have measureless charm and the most courteous manner, and in slow, correct English told us of how he had perfected his tactics in Baltic exercises before the war, how he had put them into practice in the Atlantic, and how, on the night after his capture, he had played bridge in the day-cabin of Captain Macintyre with one of the ship's lieutenants and the captains of two merchant ships he had sunk, and then slept (for Captain Macintyre was in his sea-cabin) in Captain Macintyre's bunk.
After the war captor and captive became friends, and Otto showed us the Zeiss binoculars which Macintyre had taken off him as a trophy of war, but had recently handed back.
As we went away to the sounds of Mrs Otto's profuse good-byes, I reflected on the nature of the relationship between her and Otto, almost the opposite to what one might have expected: the gallant captain going off to sea where his <head>authority</head>was absolute and his orders brooked no delay, and returning to a wife whom he clearly adored but where the roles were reversed.

The specifications of November 1939 became a reality just 43 years ago, when a CW pump evacuated model with sealing wax joints was switched on for the first time at the end of February 1940, and operated successfully.
Visible streams of what turned out to be high frequency radiation flowed from the output lead and burnt out all the de-capped car headlamps we could find!
A little later we used a Lecher-wire system to determine the wavelength at 9.8 cm.
From then on, development of the magnetron became a cooperative effort between university and industry in the UK: E. C. S. Megaw of the Research Laboratories of the GEC was let into the secret and went back to Wembley to construct the first sealed-off model.
In September 1940 the Tizard Mission, including J. D. Cockcroft, E. G. Bowen and R. H. Fowler, visited the Us and showed the magnetron to the <head>authorities</head>and to the Bell Telephone Company who got it working in a single weekend.

He may even meet some Poles who demonstrate against him.
While nine Poles in ten call themselves Roman Catholics, they are discovering, with the help of a free press, that they disagree, sometimes violently, over the Catholic church's role in their public life and private morality. [/p] [p]

I should not yield to theirs unless I see its point and come to agree with them.
Here the normal justification thesis establishes the credentials of John and Ruth as authorities in their fields.
But whether or not there is a complete justification for me to regard their advice or instructions as guides to my conduct in the way I regard a binding authoritative directive depends on my other goals.
In such cases while talking of a person as being an authority one refrains from talking of him as in authority over oneself, and avoids regarding his advice or instructions as binding, even when, given one's goals, one ought to treat it in exactly the same way as one treats a binding authoritative directive.

Eccleshall himself implicitly acknowledges this problem, for he notes at one point that Thatcherism's characteristics &mdash; &bquo;its mixture of abrasively theoretical market economics, uncompromising anti-egalitarianism and fervent patriotism&equo; &mdash; are hardly &bquo;the ingredients of what Oakeshottians judge to be authentic Conservatism&equo;.

As the York writer noted, the king did not love Anselm after he had thwarted him in the matter of investitures.
Henceforth he supported York until Anselm's death brought him back to his father's policy of supporting the unity of the Church under the southern see, By this time, however, it was too late to alter the general swing away from overlordships such as that claimed by Canterbury.
If anything permanent were to be achieved, it should have been done under Rufus.

Christian teachings are expressions of the religious awareness in its Christian form.
They can only be understood, and their truth can only be measured, by reference back to that awareness.
To treat them simply as statements of objective fact, to be proved or disproved by appeal to observation of the world around us, to the speculations and arguments of metaphysical philosophy, or even to the authority of the Bible understood as a collection of &bquo;divine truths&equo;, is to misconceive their nature and function.
To say, for example, that God is the Creator and Preserver of the world, is to give particular expression to the awareness of absolute dependence; and it is in and through that awareness that the meaning and truth alike of the doctrinal affirmation are opened up.

But by this time the Crown was assessing the royal forests, not so much as hunting preserves but as sources of timber, especially for ship-building.
As early as 1483 an Act had been passed, legalizing the enclosure of coppices in the forests where felling had taken place, until seedling beech and oak had grown again.
New officers had to be appointed for the new objective of woodland management for timber production.
So in 1547 Henry VIII decreed the appointment of two Masters and two Surveyors of the Woods, one each for either side of the Trent, as officers of the Court of Augmentations.

This strategy has attempted to moderate expenditure while disposing of public assets.
It has not been a wholly successful policy.
In the mid-1980s, many local councils substantially overspent their cash limits.
This was due to a number of practices, including the willingness of local authorities to pre-fund or defer expenditure, and to enter into various lease-back arrangements with developers and/or funding institutions.
However, this should not hide the fact that many, especially urban, councils have capital resources that are inadequate to deal with the problems that face them.
The repair bill for public-sector accommodation is estimated to be at least &pound;20 billion in 1986 prices (Association of Metropolitan <head>Authorities</head> , 1986), a year in which total capital spending amounted to about &pound;5.5 billion. [/p] [p]

By strictly controlling the money supply they would restore sound finance and squeeze inflation out of the system.
The government would not intervene in private sector wage bargaining but intended that its own example in the public sector plus strict control of the [pb] money supply would encourage responsible wage bargaining.

The advocates of the Government's &bquo;competing currencies&equo; approach suggest that many of these gains would occur by merely moving to a &bquo;hard&equo; EMS in which currencies became progressively more fixed (3).
However, the evidence so far suggests that it is not enough to persuade businesspeople that rates will really be fixed forever.
Moreover, the process of establishing credibility is long drawn out.
The French, despite an exceptionally tough policy, still have interest rates above the German level because they are unable to persuade the markets they mean what they say when they rule out a devaluation. [/p] [p]
Nor is it sensible to argue, as the Treasury has, that a European system of central banks in charge of a single currency might prove more inflationary than a fixed exchange rate system where each monetary <head>authority</head>competed to provide a stable benchmark of value.

Lady Onslow befriended Littlejohn, who lost little time in asking her to arrange a meeting between a Government minister and his brother Kenneth, who, he said, had some important intelligence about the IRA to pass on. [/p] [p]
Lady Onslow, who was of Anglo-Irish extraction, contacted her friend Lord Carrington, who was then Minister for Defence.
A meeting was arranged between Kenneth Littlejohn and Mr Geoffrey Johnson Smith, Minister for the Army, at Lady Onslow's house. [/p] [p]
A degree of immunity from prosecution for theft was certainly given to Kenneth Littlejohn in return for information about the IRA.
The brothers went on to operate as secret agents in the Republic of Ireland under cover of a company called Whizz Kids, which supposedly specialised in women's hot pants. [/p] [p]

While we do this we must beware of those who are so hungry for authority in our societies that they want to press the authority of the Bible over men and the Church in such a way as to lead to extravagance or to sectarianism.
On the other side we must assert freedom of enquiry.
We must accept that study has proved that the Bible is not historically true in all its parts; we must declare that no Christian need suppose the book of Genesis to be an accurate physical account of the making of the world, nor mind if study proves contradictions in the different accounts in the gospels.
The divine spirit is at work not only in the consciences but also in the minds of humanity, and the careful study of the texts is a [pb] part of that.

Nevertheless, the busy life which goes on in the unconscious profoundly affects our feelings and reactions in our conscious, outer life.
Thus it comes about that the patterns of object-relationships which exist in the unconscious inner world determine the kinds of immature object-relations which people sustain in their outer world.

The ratio of prisoners, primarily adult males, to the population of Texas as a whole has usually been high, and higher than for most other American states.

The prison population now stands at around 40,000, which was that of England and Wales prior to the 1980s increase, against a total state population of rather more than half that of England and Wales.

Holzner goes further than Berger and Luckmann by describing two &bquo;foci of reality construction&equo; beyond that of everyday life &mdash; specialized knowledge and ideological knowledge.
The former are organized around the activities of work that give individuals and work communities a specialized knowledge not available or necessary in everyday fife.

The instrumental value of consent to the authority of just governments is to be seen as reinforcing other moral motives to support just institutions where those may fail due to human ignorance or weakness.
Consent may produce the results that belief in other reasons should but may fail to produce.
This is particularly valuable in the case of government officials.
Their power to affect the public and the importance of public confidence in their loyalty give special importance to their fidelity to justified authority.
Hence reinforcing this fidelity by consent is a valuable common practice in many countries.
Consent, duly qualified, can play a subordinate but none the less valuable role in reinforcing independent obligations. [/p] [p]
Against this undoubted benefit one has to set the likely bad consequences of recognizing the general and unqualified validity of consent to political <head>authority</head> .

Are political authorities to be equated with big Daddy who knows best?
Second, again the suspicion must creep back that the exclusive concentration on the individual blinds one to the real business of government, which is to co-ordinate and control large populations. [/p] [p]
These doubts stem from a failure to appreciate the many ways in which the communal character of political authorities affects their claim to legitimacy [hi]vis-a-vis [/hi] each individual.

The fact that political authorities rule over whole communities itself dictates some of the ways in which the question of the justification of such authorities should be formulated.

The armies varied in style; whilst the Saxon thegns rode horses, they invariably fought on foot, with axes, and the defensive position forced relative immobility on their troops, with the central professional nucleus, the [hi]housecarls [/hi], surrounding the king.
The Normans, by comparison, were led by armoured and fairly mobile knights, backed by a barrage of archers and organised groups of spear and swordsmen. [/p] [p]
The battle took place on a Saturday, 14 October: because the armies were so evenly matched and the ground so difficult it lasted eight hours, a great time in a world where a decision was usually reached in just over two hours.
The Bayeux tapestry gives a magnificent cartoon report of the action, but it needs to be seen as a piece of victorious Norman propaganda; it is to be doubted that the English spent the previous night in carousing whilst the Normans engaged in earnest prayer.

Although the Central Authority initially resisted the more direct encroachment of Whitehall on the Area Boards (successfully insisting that communication should normally be through the Authority), the semi-political process which determined the Whitehall allocation of resources to electricity was mirrored within the British Electricity Authority.
The division of power and cash between the Authority itself (responsible for generation) and the Area Boards (responsible for distribution) was subject to a complex process of bargaining not only with the Ministry but also internally, with discussion there directed as much to political, consensual ends as to traditional commercial disciplines.
This was pre-eminently the case where the Area Boards were united in opposing the Central <head>Authority</head>or the Government (as on the Clow differential), though Citrine was more willing to give in to such pressure on matters where he respected the Board Chairmen's views, such as tariffs, than on matters where he was determined to impose his own, as in labour relations.

Today Mudge's views read like a classic case study of most elements of nineteenth-century racism.
His mixture of Social Darwinism, categorization of national and racial types, the Manichean conflict between Aryan and Jew, reading of personality from physical attributes, primitive eugenics, the aesthetic ideal of beauty and the use of middle-class value judgements were all symptomatic of this.
So too was the assumed superiority of Nordic men and Anglo-Saxon nations.
Particularly significant was the fact that despite the Nordics' supposed love of liberty the more authoritarian qualities were emphasized, and there appeared to be a shift from traditional nineteenth-century assumptions of Anglo-Saxon <head>authority</head>over colonial peoples to an elitist anti-democratic control of &bquo;Nordics&equo; over &bquo;Mediterraneans&equo; within British society.

Though some of these reasons are currently out of fashion in discussions of political authority I believe they all have their role to play, though some are more important in some societies than in others.
The last has for a long time been the argument most favoured by political theorists. [/p] [p]
It is easy to see why so many people, from Hobbes onwards, have regarded the possession of [hi]de facto [/hi] power, of actual effective power over the behaviour of people, as crucial to the possession of legitimate authority.
If there is any range of activities in which those who possess great power clearly can do better than most people it is in co-ordinating the activities of many people.
It seems plausible to suppose that unless a person enjoys or is soon likely to acquire effective power in a society he does not possess legitimate political authority over that society.
He may deserve to have such <head>authority</head> .

In February 1983 I announced in the House of Commons that health authorities should put their ancillary services out to tender to see whether they would get best value from private or in-house organizations. [/p] [p]
Six months later, in September, I followed this up with a circular to health authorities requiring them to put their services out to tender.
They were not forced to use private contractors but they were required to make a judgement on the best value for their health authority.
The policy was met with predictable howls of rage from unions like NUPE, and nor did every Health Authority throw their hats in the air with glee.
It was easier for them to demand money from the Government than argue plans past their local unions.
The health service has its fair share of people who want a quiet life and perhaps more than its fair share of <head>Authority</head>members who, for political reasons, opposed the policy itself.

If another's reasoning is usually better than mine, then comparing on each occasion our two sets of arguments may help me detect my mistake and mend my reasoning.
It may help me more indirectly by alerting me to the fact that I may be wrong, and forcing me to reason again to double check my conclusion.
But if neither is sufficient to bring my performance up to the level of the other person then my optimific course is to give his decision pre-emptive force.
So long as this is done where improving the outcome is more important than deciding for oneself this acceptance of authority, far from being either irrational or an abdication of moral responsibility, is in fact the most rational course and the right way to discharge one's responsibilities.

Alongside the new universities themselves, starting their degree courses from scratch and employing large numbers of sometimes rather dubiously qualified new lecturers, there was a parallel development in the polytechnics, many of them offering degree courses for the first time, and devising courses in subjects such as literature, languages, and philosophy that had nothing whatever to do with the technology-based courses for which they had first been invented.
All this local authority-financed expansion was subject to the liberal, though very thorough, validation procedures of the newly invented Council for National Academic Awards (CNAA).
The Council was charged with the task of seeing that the new courses were of degree standard, but was powerless to adjudicate on the wisdom or otherwise of there being so many arts-orientated courses in the first place.
It seemed in truth a time of indulgent expansion; and, as if in retribution, students of all kinds, in universities old and new and in the polytechnics, became more and more resistant to <head>authority</head> , not just social authority, but the academic authority of their teachers and of the disciplines within which they were studying.

In Europe the three current structures that are probably most used are the Dutch company with a Swiss branch, the Belgian co-ordination centre and &mdash; a relative newcomer &mdash; the Irish Dublin Docks company. [/p] [p]
Although occasionally Dutch finance companies with Antillean parents (taxed at a turn on the interest in the Netherlands) are still seen, for the past few years the perceived wisdom has been that the Swiss finance branch structure is superior.
This structure rests on the Dutch/Swiss treaty, under which income arising in the branch is basically 90% exempted from tax in the Netherlands.
Simultaneously, the Swiss cantonal <head>authorities</head>treat a large proportion of the branch capital as a loan from head office and give a deemed deduction for interest thus greatly reducing the actual Swiss taxable profit without affecting the treaty allocation mentioned above.

The documents of the Second Vatican Council have provided the Catholic Church with what is undoubtedly the weightiest body of official teaching in the twentieth century.
However, although the Council said an awful lot, much of it was rather long-winded; moreover, it avoided solemn definitions and almost avoided direct condemnations.
Its teaching is not &mdash; at least for the most part &mdash; either definitive or exclusive of error.
Nevertheless, the <head>authority</head>of an ecumenical Council, more representative of the whole world than any previous Council, working responsibly and prayerfully across four years with all the support it could get from the ablest theologians, is clearly in human and ecclesial terms as considerable as can be.

In Kufra, in 1979, some people did not pay their contribution to the small boy who visited the houses, so their shaikh went in person.
They explained that they were poor and that the sick man was rich and could afford to stay in bed without working.
Rather than arguing that lineage solidarity demanded their contribution, or that he had decided and his decision bound them, the shaikh pooh-poohed their claim of poverty, and disputed the invalid's alleged wealth.
He presented himself as organizer of reciprocities (&bquo;Am I to ask them for a dinar when you are sick?&equo;) rather than as lineage banker: he noticeably did not raise issues of authority.
Although differences in wealth were a potential threat to lineage welfare systems the recusants on this occasion did not want to challenge the shaikh's [pb] <head>authority</head> , at least not on these grounds, and after half an hour's discussion they paid up.

The abbot of F&eacute;camp put the same question to Ivo of Chartres, who produced the text of Pope Hyginus, misquoted by Anselm but available in the Canon Law collection of Burchard of Worms.
It supported Anselm's conclusion.
So, after travelling half round Christendom, this small problem finally had an acceptable solution, and Anselm had been right after all, against the views of both pope and Curia. [/p] [p]
The difficulty experienced by the abbot of F&eacute;camp in getting a decision on this small point has both a general and a particular interest.
In general, it illustrates the amateurish state of government at this time: there were as yet no doctors of Canon Law, no schools in which the subject was studied, no lectures, no centres of expert knowledge.
It is indeed strange that Anselm never referred the question to Ivo, bishop of Chartres: he knew him as a friend, but not apparently as the greatest <head>authority</head>on Canon Law in northern Europe.

The 1962 Hospital Plan (MoH, 1962) and the 1971 Formula (DHSS, 1970) did attempt to reduce these inequalities at the regional level, but the evidence indicated that inequalities within regions exceeded those between regions (Cooper and Culyer, 1970).
Prior to 1974, however, planning health care and equalising resources below the regional level was difficult, due largely to the absence, in the hospital sector, of a geographically based planning and management tier below the level of the region.
The pre-1974 sub-regional tier, the Hospital Management Committee (HMC), was responsible for running a hospital or a [pb] group of hospitals and rarely had specific responsibilities to ensure that the needs of a defined population were met. [/p] [p]

Sir Kenneth, for example, set up multi-agency panels to deal with the cautioning of juveniles, designed to keep as many as possible out of the courts.
But in many boroughs, Mr Easey said, &bquo;we began to find that whatever we said, they'd go ahead and charge them anyway&equo;.

However, the continuation of a tradition of appointed local boards cannot be taken as a vote of confidence in their predecessors.
The White Paper makes trenchant criticisms of Health Authorities, particularly the &bquo;long standing lack of clarity about (their) role&equo; (para 8.4).
The system of appointment coupled with effective nomination rights by some interests and local government meant that they were &bquo;neither truly representative nor management&equo; (para 5.4).
Consequently, the government felt that they would be ill equipped &bquo;to handle the complex managerial and contractual issues&equo; of the new arrangements (para 8.5). [/p] [p]

The Croatian war destroyed the fragile balance in Bosnia.
Muslim and Croat politicians voted in October, 1991, despite the veto rule, to make Bosnia a state.
The Serbs refused to accept Bosnian neutrality in the war next-door.
They left parliament and set up &bquo;Serb autonomous regions&equo;.
The aim was to join Croatian and Serbian Serbs in a Greater Serbia. [/p] [p]
The independence of Croatia and Slovenia left Bosnians a terrible choice: staying with Serbia and Montenegro or declaring an independent state, sovereign and recognised but unable to defend itself.
Freed from duty in Croatia by the peace of January 1992, federal troops were soon being redeployed in Bosnia as part of the Serb forces there, under General Radko Mladic. [/p] [p]

Some of the sexism feminists have identified in (English) usage is of an &bquo;everyday&equo; type &mdash; for example, conventions for addressing women and vocabulary available to insult them.
This kind of sexism can be (and has been) noted, but it is hard to get rid of because it occurs in &bquo;unregulated&equo; contexts: nobody has made or written down a rule saying that women can be addressed as &bquo;dearie&equo; or referred to as &bquo;bitches&equo;.
In these cases, analysis may have to suffice, or feminists may have to be content with informal, guerilla-style resistance. [/p] [p]

Though after the Lateran Pact of 1929, which settled the conflict between the Holy See and Italy, the Bishop of Rome was no longer a (self-imposed) &bquo;prisoner in the Vatican&equo;, the papacy's isolation remained, heightened in popular consciousness by the war years.
His readiness to speak on almost any topic, and especially on medical ethics, was remarkable: his speeches averaged out over the pontificate at almost one a day.
Though (except for the definition of the bodily Assumption of Mary in November 1950) none of these declarations fell into the formal category of infallible as defined at Vatican I, none the less Catholics came to expect authoritative guidance from Rome on all manner of issues &mdash; a strong tendency within the Church down to the present day.

From this point of view, which could make no place for miracles understood as cases of divine, supernatural interference with the laws of nature, reports of alleged miracles could only be regarded as evidence of credulity and ignorance on the part of those who originated and passed on the stories.
The Bible's miracles, so far from supporting its claim to supernatural authority, served rather to undermine its credibility.
So the same kind of stark opposition grew up between orthodoxy and rationalism on the matter of miracles as on the authority of the Bible; and the issues raised then have surfaced again in a number of forms since. [/p] [p]
Before we move on, it is worth noticing that just as the debate about the Bible rested to a large extent on a rather dubious notion of what kind of <head>authority</head>was in question, so too the argument about miracles was one in which both sides generally shared an equally questionable concept.

The earliest that the whole &mdash; more or less &mdash; of the industry will be able to take advantage of its single market now looks like being mid-1994. [/p] [p]
That is the European Commission's unstated timetable for EC member countries to implement its third life-insurance directive, whose draft it published on February 20th.
The directive, which follows a similar directive on non-life insurance published in draft a few months ago, is the last big element in its push to open financial markets that are still highly protected. [/p] [p]
The broad idea is that financial-service companies should have the right to operate throughout the EC on the basis of a single &bquo;passport&equo;, issued by the supervisory <head>authority</head>in their home country.

For the anarchists, the POUM and sections of the Socialist left the social revolution within the Republican zone had become the chief reason for fighting fascism and, indeed, the only basis upon which workers and poor peasants could be expected to fight it.
Bourgeois Republicans and right-wing Socialists like Prieto, Minister of Navy and Air in the Largo Caballero cabinet, and Dr Juan Negr&iacute;n, Minister of Finance, argued that collectivization caused economic disruption and would alienate the lower-middle-class [pb] and better-off peasantry from the Republic.
As for the militias, however zealous and heroic, they had no chance of triumphing over the Nationalist armies.
Governmental <head>authority</head>must be restored, the economy and war-effort be efficiently managed, and the chaotic militias be replaced by a disciplined conventional army. [/p] [p]

By the Domestic Violence and Matrimonial proceedings Act 1976, protection against eviction from the dwelling a mistress has shared with her lover was introduced, and a host of cases decided under the Act have proved the efficacy of this enactment to safeguard a woman's residential rights, often against physical violence by her former partner.

The husband will be presumed, in the ordinary case where husband and wife live together, and she orders goods to meet the household needs, to have authorized her to pledge his credit for that purpose, unless he has supplied her with sufficient ready money.
But there is no general rule that the husband is liable for his wife's debts.
The husband may, for instance, decide that the needs of the household shall be provided for by a housekeeper, and that the wife shall have no authority to contract on his behalf.
And the shopkeeper who supplies goods to a married woman without inquiry is not entitled to assume that she has her husband's <head>authority</head> .

Especially when [pb] the complainant's village was relatively remote and the headmen themselves in league with the thieves, the long trip to court with little prospect of success was made even more unattractive by the possibility of violence.
Officials complained that cattle stealers often harassed the complainant and members of his family, sometimes by the institution of false criminal charges. [/p] [p]
False cases offset under-reporting to some extent.
Officials varied widely in their estimates as to their extent.
Some seem to have thought that if a case could be traced to a feud, it was false.
This assumption was not necessarily justified, for the feud may have been a motive for the theft, or it may have determined whom the complainant decided to accuse in a case of real theft when the thieves were unknown.
Other accusations were the result of disputes over the ownership of animals.
The <head>authorities</head>considered these cases suitable for civil, not criminal, legal proceedings.

There are tenth-century references to red-eared white cattle in Wales and they were considered far more valuable than black cattle, being often used as propitiatory gifts.
The White Welsh today has black points, very like the [hi]White Park [/hi]; this is not surprising as there has been a close connection between the two and White Park bulls have quite often been used on Welsh cows.
The White Park, which in the past was as much a colour type as a breed, had several representatives in Wales such as the Chartley herd and the Vaynol or Faenol Park herd at Bangor (originally from Scotland).
Indeed, several <head>authorities</head>have striven to prove that the [hi]Pembroke [/hi] and the White Park are different only in colour and that the Pembroke was a direct descendant of those tenth-century red-eared whites.

The reason this conclusion is objectionable is because the locution &bquo;X has authority to pass laws of kind X&equo; indicates in most contexts that X has the authority to issue such laws in order to use it to make such laws.
That is, it implies that part of the reason for his authority is that it be used in this way.

There [pb] was very little sign in this report of constructive planning to use social work skills to support old people and their carers. [/p] [p]
The constraint for social workers wanting to do family work with elderly clients is to be allowed the time to do it at all.
A way forward indicated in the Wagner Report (1988, p. 3.6) identified a role for a nominated social worker.
This builds on the work of the Kent Community Care Project.
The key worker or case manager role, identified in the research, uses social work time productively to help maintain a vulnerable person in his/her home, and not using more costly residential care.
This requires understanding by manager and social worker alike (Davies and Challis, 1986).
The Griffiths report (1988, p. 6.4) recommended regular assessment, with appropriate supporting services arranged through social service <head>authorities</head> . [/p] [/div2] [div2] [head]

The diners at my table simply lit more Gauloises and scoffed at the
suggestion of interrupting a perfectly good Saturday morning to go golfing
or even montgolfing (ballooning to you; the brothers Montgolfier, French of
course, were the world's first hot-air balloonists).  Back in the U.S.A.
this kind of chi-chi airborne activity wins heartwarmingly covetous
responses.  As in: ``You went ballooning?!!  In France?!!'' Americans it
seems have followed Malcolm Forbes's hot-air lead and taken to ballooning
in a heady way.  During the past 25 years, the number of balloonists (those
who have passed a Federal Aviation <head>Authority</head>

thousand, with some estimates running as high as 10,000.

The Fletcher Challenge Canada stake was then canceled, Doman said, raising
Doman's interest in Western Forest to 56 %.  Doman said it was also granted
an option to acquire the remaining 44 % interest in Western Forest, which
is currently held by two Canadian banks.  International Forest, Western
Forest, and Fletcher Challenge Canada are Vancouver-based forest products
concerns.  The Canadian government introduced in the House of Commons
legislation to extend federal regulatory authority over provincial
government-owned telephone utilities in Alberta, Saskatchewan and Manitoba.
The legislation would open the way for more telephone services and more
competition in the telephone business in the three provinces, federal
officials said.  The federal government initiative follows a recent
Canadian Supreme Court decision that held that the major telephone
companies in Alberta, Saskatchewan and Manitoba and in the Atlantic coast

objecting to, among other things, a plan to give more weight to
cost-benefit considerations in evaluating pesticides.  ``It's a tremendous
disappointment,'' said Janet Hathaway, an attorney with the Natural

a chemical whenever the benefits outweigh the risks is absolutely anathema
to the environmental community.'' The Bush administration plans to announce

Professors Philip Kurland of the University of Chicago and Laurence Tribe
of Harvard Law School said any effort by President Bush to claim authority
for a line-item veto would contradict the text of the Constitution and the
intent of its authors, as well as the views of previous presidents.  A
line-item veto is a procedure that would allow a president to veto part of
a big congressional spending bill without having to scuttle the entire
measure.  Mr. Bush has said he would like to be able to use this procedure.
A White House spokesman said last week that the president is considering
declaring that the Constitution implicitly gives him the authority for a
line-item veto to provoke a test case.  But the two legal experts,
responding to an inquiry by Sen. Edward Kennedy (D., Mass.), wrote in a
joint letter that the president ``lacks the constitutional
<head>authority</head> to exercise a line-item veto.''

At one point, Hammersmith is reported to have accounted for as much as 10 %
of the sterling market in interest-rate swap dealings.  When two parties
engage in an interest-rate swap, they are betting against each other on
future rates.  Thus, an institution obligated to make fixed-rate interest
payments on debt swaps the payments with another making floating-rate
payments.  In most of the British transactions, the municipalities agreed
to make floating-rate payments to banks, which would make fixed-rate
payments.  As interest rates rose, municipalities owed the banks more than
the banks were paying them.  The court hearing began in early October at
the request of Anthony Hazell, district auditor for Hammersmith, who argued
that local councils are n't vested with constitutional
<head>authority</head> to engage in such capital-markets activities.

The main point of interest here is the bends in bar 2 which follow the 4ths in bar 1.
These involve bending the b5&ndash;5 and the 6-&flat;7, therefore implying an A7 chord sound.
Be very careful to pitch these bends correctly &mdash; they will sound awful if they are inaccurate. [/p] [p]
Fig 3 is the intro to [hi]Pride And Joy [/hi].
The main rhythm part of this example is very similar to the walking bass idea that we saw in fig 2 of last month's article.
So the same guidelines apply: pick the bass notes hard and the top notes a little softer to give the impression of two independent parts being played simultaneously.
Also, the turnaround found in <head>bars</head> 13&ndash;16 is a little tricky so, if you have any problems, break it down into small parts and practise it slowly, only building up the speed when you're feeling more comfortable. [/p] [p]

As Dorothy Wade found out, most experts believe that childhood mistakes are an important part of growing up [/head] [head]
By DOROTHY WADE [/head] [p]
PARENTS' disapproval of their child's friends can begin at a surprisingly young age.
When Jonathan, aged three, the son of professional parents, went to a respectable church nursery school he quickly became firm friends with a rowdy boy called Jason, who had a broad Cockney accent and a permanently dripping nose. [/p] [p]
&bquo;I knew I was just being snooty,&equo; says his mother in some embarrassment, &bquo;but I wondered why Jonathan was attracted to the child with the most disadvantaged background.
We went to Jason's birthday party and the kids sat and ate mountains of gooey cake, chocolate <head>bars</head> and ice-cream for about two hours while all the adults smoked over them.

This means that palette 2 is now being shown.
Keep clicking on NEXT and the whole range of palettes will be displayed in ascending numerical order.

In late Visean, a displacement of the basin towards the north took place. [/p] [p]
During Namurian time the main influx of material came from the &bquo;Old-Red Continent&equo;, the Fenno-Scandian Shield in the north-east.
To a lesser extent material was supplied from the south.
Confirmation is found in the increase of coarser sands and number of conglomeratic intervals towards the south within the alluvial fans. [/p] [p]
The Westphalian age is characterised by alternating conglomerates, sands, silts and claystones in very distinct cycles of transgressive and regressive phases.
There was deposition in large alluvial fans stretching out from the mountains in the south and the north-east into the flat plain.

In short, theology is no longer simply taken for granted or even accepted by society at large.
This is a situation of which modern theologians have been well aware &mdash; often too much so for the comfort of many in the churches &mdash; and with which they have tried in various ways to deal. [/p] [p]
Within that wider development, the credibility of Christian faith itself first came to be seriously challenged in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries &mdash; in what is commonly called the [hi]Age of Reason [/hi] or the [hi]Enlightenment [/hi].
The chief mark of that period was a new confidence in the power of reason, as opposed to acceptance of authority, to discover truth: we find things out, not simply by believing what someone else tells us, but by considering the evidence, reflecting upon it, and accepting what can &bquo;prove itself at the <head>bar</head> of reason&equo;.

She goes back to his four-room bachelor apartment at 52 Riverside Drive.
They go to bed as strangers and then spend the weekend alternately insulting each other and making up, trying to find out if they are fond of each other.
We learn with them that he designs furniture (as Harry Hoffman did) and she works in a gallery of primitive art on Madison Avenue, but only in the end do they reveal their names to each other.
When they first meet at the bar, he says to her, &bquo;What did you say your name was?&equo; 'I didn't say.

ROOFING A CONSERVATORY [/head] [p]
If you're planning to build your own lean-to sun room or conservatory, it is essential to get the roof right.
If you don't, there will be endless problems with leaks.
One efficient method of covering the roof is to combine twin wall Lexon Thermoclear sheeting with Twinfix aluminium structural glazing bar.
So before launching out to buy materials, send for literature from each company.
This will help with recommendations such as the ratio between sheet thickness, width and the distances between glazing <head>bar</head> centres.

So it was naturally with great affection and nostalgia that as an adult I laced up my boots on a damp October morning at the starting point in the station car park at Bridge of Orchy, in preparation to find out what really lurked at the top of Beinn Dorain.
I've always found the settlements on the A82 between Crianlarich and Glencoe most peculiar.
Crianlarich, Tyndrum and Bridge of Orchy are melancholy, stranded little hamlets that the internal combustion engine has mutated into service stations for coach parties and crumpled, travel-weary motorists.
A gift shop, a snack <head>bar</head> and a petrol station is not exactly a model, thriving Highland community, and the disquieting feeling that these places now exist only to empty the contents of your wallet if you so much as slow down is not a pleasant one.

Thus walls were often covered with, and the bar partitions made of, tongue-and-groove boarding, which was often grained.
Floors were frequently made from bare wooden boards or stone slab.
The exception was in the treatment of the bar itself, which was often treated as a decorative eyecatcher. [/p] [p]
This approach to design could formerly be seen in the Public Bar of the White Swan, Bradford Street, Deritend, Birmingham (owned by Allied's Ansells division).
This 1900 pub has a tongue-and-groove dado, about which the walls are covered with glazed tiles.
The focus of the design was the decorative bar and its back display area, whose strong lighting made it the centrepiece of the pub.
This concept has, however, been ruined by the introduction of a <head>bar</head> overhang with secondary lighting which obscure views of the back-bar display.

Retiring tenants sell their tenancy to a purchaser who must be approved by the company: applications are handled by Estates, usually by Mike Lester personally.
As is customary in the trade, tenants purchase all fixtures and fittings (including bar furnishings), initially from the company and subsequently from the outgoing tenant.
Goodwill is specifically excluded from the selling price (again, this is customary in the trade).
The price is invariably agreed on the basis of figures submitted by an independent licensed property valuer.
The price at which tenancies change hands is currently within the range &pound;115,000 to &pound;155,000. [/p] [p]
Tenants are required to purchase all liquor, soft drinks and <head>bar</head> items such as crisps and tobacco from Palatine, though at a discount, and they are expected to make their living from the profits after deduction of rent (paid to Palatine), wages, rates, lighting and heating, etc.

He'd use it to identify and locate all the landmarks which he had stared up at during his exhausting explorations, now seen from a very different perspective; he knew the names of all the streets where the distant, anonymous towers of the banks and finance companies were sited, having worn himself out many times by walking along them, fascinated by the scenes glimpsed behind their mirrored, darkened or tinted glass windows and walls.
Now he'd sit and stare at those same walls made transparent by all the lights left on at night.
From his local library he got photocopies of the maps of his district for 1811, 1843 and 1871; he'd sit there and try to work out how the changes in the maps related to the view at night; where the darkness of rookeries, courts and tenements had been replaced with the darkness of lampless parks and public gardens.

The year is 1977. [/p] [p]
That was the year I went on my first diet.
I cut it out of [hi]Cosmopolitan [/hi] magazine: an article entitled &bquo;Think Yourself Thin&equo;, illustrated by a blonde woman in a bikini being carried on the arms of two grinning, solid young men.
The bikini is tiny, three triangles of cotton crochet, and her ribs protrude so much that she looks as if she is made of corrugated paper.
I keep her photograph under my pillow, for inspiration. [/p] [p]

I stayed with my mother's parents in Eltham and I wrote to every theatre company and virtually every person in the world, but nobody would even look at me because I hadn't done drama school.
Then a film that I'd made in India opened, and the producer of the film gave me a list of agents' names, and said, &bquo;You are going to be a star.
This is the list of all the people you have to ring up.&equo;
One of these unlikely people was Malcolm Muggeridge.
How I thought he could help me I don't know, but he invited me for lunch, anyway, and he was lovely.

Why should not people do as they pleased with their own bodies?
And I thought some of the girls were extraordinarily attractive in their outrageous costumes and theatrical make-up.
I envied them their sexual freedom and their self-assured dignity, and I despised the British vice squads that ran them in and were not above enjoying their charms for a consideration.
Since I hated the police, it was natural that I should feel myself aligned with the prostitutes. [/p] [p]

An Ian McEwan novel adapted by Harold Pinter and shot by Paul Schrader in a very Orientalised Venice, mannered Anglo angst meets muscular American attitude on the edge of the Western World.

Siobhan Redmond I'd seen once in a revue by Marcella for St Andrews University and I tracked her down in Glasgow and asked her would she like to do a show for buttons for the newly opened Tron Theatre, who were interested.

&bquo;Dylan as an actor and as an explosive performing force was a dangerous rival for other actors, as I know, for I worked with him a few times or several, and once for instance a director &lsqb;Douglas Cleverdon&rsqb; said to him &mdash; we were rehearsing a radio play at the time &mdash; Dylan, will you take the words &bquo;Mam!
Mam!&equo; and scream them for me.
You understand that you are dying in no man's land, and when you hear the Royal Welch sing, I will give you a cue light and then scream for me, woodjew, there's a good chap.
And the Royal Welch did sing in the rehearsal, it was a record of course, and they sang of what you could see from the hills above Jerusalem, and it was in the minor key and sad as the devil or death, and the green light flickered, [pb] and Dylan, short, bandy, prime, obese, and famous among the <head>bars</head> , screamed as I have never heard, but sometimes imagined a scream, and we were all appalled, our pencils silent above the crossword puzzles, and invisible centuries&rehy;gone atavistic hair rose on our backs.

The code number is read into the computer, and then the text string for that number is read from the computer's data base.
Without this massive data base, all you read in from the bar code is a meaningless number. [/p] [p]
This is a good way of doing things in that it enables what is effectively a limitless number of different codes to be used, with as little or as much data as desired being attached to each code.
The data associated with each code number can be as small as the price such as &bquo;38p&equo;, or 100,000 words of text.
The upper limit on the amount of data is set by the database that has to handle it all, rather than by the car code system. [/p] [p]

In Sheffield (Britain's fourth largest city) the only gay facility at the time was an upstairs bar in a pub called The King William.
To get to this bar you had to pass through a billiard room full of jeering straight men.
It amazed me to think that even though the gay bar had been situated up those dark stairs for many years, the straight men downstairs managed to keep up the impetus so that no queen should pass without an insult.
Indeed, the only people willing to endure this ordeal on a regular basis were the screaming queens who had already decided that the best way to cope was to flaunt it. [/p] [p]

It was decided to build a huge central market, the construction of which was entrusted to Baltard, a man who was as much an engineer as an architect, on a site which had existed since the reign of Napoleon I. Succeeding regimes had neither had the will nor the drive to carry out the project as originally planned, but the Emperor was determined that this new market should be one of the earliest major building projects of his reign.
He indicated to Haussmann that the form of the railway station, a huge open space covered by glass, had impressed him as a possible model and as a result of the Emperor's predilections, and Baltard's skill, the great new market of Les Halles was built in a light, airy combination of iron, stone and glass.
Its ten pavilions were to serve Paris for over a century and to take their place in the city's folklore.
From its inception, the new market was gas-lit, thus permitting night-time operations, so that the area became one of nocturnal rendez-vous &mdash; its caf&eacute;s and <head>bars</head> open when all else was closed.

Mirth is never the most important part of a man's life and can indeed be irksome in times of depression or trouble.
Nor can it lift a man unaided from his melancholy.

The plans would seem to have the merit both of broadening the spectrum of judges and giving the consumer greater choice. [/p] [p]
Almost to a man, barristers fought the scheme.
Some of their arguments, such as that their professional standards were higher than could be maintained by law &mdash; as envisaged in the legislation &mdash; had a ring of truth to them.
But there was an unmistakable whiff of vested interest about the howls of outrage.
They had a considerable army of former lawyers to call upon in parliament, and the comments of the former lord chancellor, Lord Hailsham, that the Government was &bquo;thinking with its bottom and sitting on its head&equo; caused a flurry or two.
In the end, the hapless Lord Mackay's proposals were considerably watered down.

There is no evidence that zinc metal was ever prepared in Africa &mdash; it has to be made by condensation since it volatilises before it can be reduced from the ore.

Brass made from metallic zinc was patented in England in [/p] [p]
1781 so Benin alloys exceeding 30 per cent of zinc must be later than this date. [/p] [p]
There is plenty of documentary evidence that brass objects were imported into Benin from Europe by sea and no one doubts that this was the main source of the metal from the 16th century onwards.
In earlier periods, some metal was traded across the Sahara Desert.

The first, initiated by a former minister, Sir Geoffrey Pattie, calls for tendering to allow the size of the bid and the programming quality to be judged in tandem when awarding contracts. [/p] [p]
The second is put down by a another sacked minister, Mr George Walden, who opposes the bill in principle.
He also voices concern about loss of quality once the bill is put into practice.
A third group of backbenchers is concerned at cross-media ownership in the new channels under the bill.

Moreover, she had shown that, even if she was only regent and not queen, let alone king, she was, like the Stewart kings themselves, a formidable personality, all too able to impose her policies. [/p] [p]
The Frenchwoman who was the major politician of the 1550s was therefore deeply in tune with two centuries of Scottish political tradition.
Only in the last months of her life did it appear that her policy might not be sustained, because of the changed situation in England and France.
In that sense, she died a failure; but she died with the respect, even admiration, not just of her supporters, but of those Protestant lords who had struggled against her.
In the person of Mary of Guise, it had been made abundantly clear that neither a French background nor an assertive Protestant aristocracy was a <head>bar</head> to the exercise of power and the acquisition of respect.

Along with the 480 watt machine comes an adjustable fence, wrenches, straight and curved guides, template guide, and even a free straight cutter. [/p] [p]
Most recent models of 6mm collet routers now produce around twice the power of this model; this is not so much to speed the work, but more to improve the quality and variety of profiles made by cutters.
Having said this, the Woodworker has a respectable 26,000rpm cutter speed, and it's also fairly light at 2kg. [/p] [p]
Cutters are fixed in place by the wrench and tommy bar method.
This is also used on some rival d-i-y machines, and is a cheaper option than a spindle lock, which needs only one tool to be used.

On the credit side, there is much for the parents as well as the teenagers to gain when the time comes for them to leave home.
The children learn to take responsibility for themselves.
However hard parents try to inculcate a sense of responsibility in their children, the habits of childhood die hard.
Most mothers haven't the heart to deny their children the care and comfort they have given them all their lives and many continue to run round them long after they are old enough to look after themselves.
In order to become a responsible adult, a young man or woman must learn the cost of living, in terms of hard cash and hard work.
While they are living at home, so many things are thrown in free.

This will change as you work, in the same way that colour 1 did, allowing you a large area of colour displayed for yarn matching. [/p] [p]
When you have completed colour 2, do the same for the remaining six colours in the palette.
You have now created a new and individual palette containing the colours you wish to use, all matched to your own yarn colours.
Bring number 1 into the current colour box and once again use the FUNCTION menu to select ERASE DRAWINGS, making the screen the background colour 1. [/p] [p]
To keep this palette in memory, there is one further step we must take and that is to save the palette.
If this is not done, then as soon as the controller is switched off, this whole palette will be lost, as it is only in the console memory, not yet on the disk. [/p] [p]
To save the new palette, select PATTERN from top menu <head>bar</head> and release the mouse button on PALETTE WRITING.

Derek had an aunt who lived not far from his new Scottish home.
Her birthday was on 21st December and he arranged a family dinner party to celebrate it.
His aunt, uncle, father and mother were present and it was held in a hotel.
At the close of the evening, he left slightly before the others to return home.
They saw him leave the room where they were sitting and begin to walk across a bar which lay between it and the entrance to the building.
A man intercepted him and began to say something.
As they watched, they saw Derek more than once attempt to continue towards the entrance, but each time the man closed up on him again.
His aunt recognised him immediately as the well-known local &bquo;drug squad&equo; detective.

This gracious and well-proportioned early 19th-century building has a varied past: it started out life as a rectory, became a farmhouse, and is now a comfortable country hotel.
It stands in three acres of garden, and overlooks the picturesque valley of Looe.
To say that it is peaceful is an understatement; it is so quiet as to be almost unsettling for anyone used to the never-ending noise of the city. [/p] [p]
The rooms are spacious and furnished to suit the Victorian features of the house, such as the marble fireplaces in the lounge and drawing room and heavy panelled doors.
The lounge (with adjacent <head>bar</head> ) is a particularly warm and welcoming room, with Persian rugs, comfortable sofas, and in winter a blazing log fire.

Sunday best pale and awkward teenagers, unsure and toughly giggly, sit around the central dance floor waiting for the first two or three to start dancing so that the rush can begin.

In addition, it was difficult to find impartial jurors.
Among the Sinhalese and Tamils, Clarence argued, convictions [pb] were difficult when the accused had a position of influence.
Burghers presented another problem: &bquo;With regard to the Eurasians, it is notoriously difficult, even upon the strongest evidence to induce a jury, in which the Eurasians are in a majority, to convict a Eurasian.&equo;
Clarence also asserted that cultural and language differences could produce misunderstandings.
European jurors know little about Sri Lankans, while Sinhalese and Tamil jurors did not always know English well enough to understand the judge. [/p] [p]

When I was a young conductor in Germany it was usual to conduct the finale much slower than we hear it nowadays.
And I knew it was wrong, but I couldn't get out of this tradition because of the difficulty of realizing the inner content of the music.
It did not &mdash; how can I put it? &mdash; lend itself to a faster tempo.
Then, eventually, both things were joined: the right tempo and the content.
Sometimes, especially in Romantic music, I tell the orchestra, &bquo;Now play everything as you played it but play a 4/4 bar.

The lead-in note to bars 1, 3 and 5 (also 18, 20 and 22, which are identical to these) are lowered by the tremolo arm before you pick them, in order to achieve the &bquo;slide&equo; effect of a &bquo;trombone&equo;.
Picking the note and then letting go of the arm allows the note to rise in pitch, giving that requisite smooth gliss into the note.
(Look back at the Cliff Gallup solos we [corr] covered[/corr] in June and July and you'll notice he did just that, too.) [/p] [p]
For the first of these (bar 1), hold the C chord I've diagrammed: press the tremolo arm to lower the C note (string 5, fret 3) to a B (equivalent to fingering at fret 2, and the reason I've written &bquo;2&equo; in the tab as the lead-in.

Face up to the fats [/head] [p]
A certain amount of fat in your diet is good for you, as it provides energy and insulation, but too much of the wrong kind can be bad news for your figure and your cholesterol levels.
The most harmful type are saturated animal fats, found in meat [corr] [/corr] and dairy products.
Switch to vegetable, nut and seed oils in cooking, like sunflower, olive or corn oil, and look out for low-fat and fat-free dairy products and other foods.
They are just as tasty as the real thing! [/p] [/div4] [/div3] [div3] [head]
FOOD FACTS [/head] [p]

16 vertebrae (22 per cent) [/p] [/item] [/list] [/p] [p]
The relative abundances are shown in brackets after each bone type for comparison with the proportions obtained from the intact scats, which are given in Append.
Table 13. (see also Append.
Table 10) Sample sizes are small (35 bones compared with 2135 from the scats), but it would appear that the numbers and proportions of isolated teeth and jaws are low compared with the numbers of vertebrae and pelves/scapulae.
This is a similar result to that from the bat-eared fox assemblage and again indicates that the lighter bones with relatively large surface areas are more subject to transport than denser bone. [gap] [ptr][/p] [caption]

I had been frantically searching the garden for Toby, and found him, his head stuck through the bars unable to move.
Don't worry folks, I knew what to do &mdash; smear some butter around the head and neck.
He snarled, growled and snapped.
Half-an-hour and half-a-pound of best Irish butter later, I had not only not succeeded, but somehow I'd got him further through.
He was now stuck just behind the shoulder blades. [/p] [p]
I phoned the fire brigade, but as the station officer's wife was having a baby in the fire engine on the way to hospital, rescuing dogs was not too high on their list of priorities.
So I tried the RSPCA inspector, but it seemed he was more concerned with a cow wandering about in a shopping mall in Carmarthen. [/p] [p]

Once upon a time, if you were caught short, there would be a convenience at your disposal.
No more.
The toilets at Piccadilly Circus closed down years ago.
They've gone at Finchley and almost everywhere else.
&bquo;Rather sadly it is a comment on modern society that keeping public loos clean and not vandalised is an uphill battle,&equo; says Dennis Tunnicliffe.
&bquo;We are looking at what you might loosely call superloos.
We're going to experiment with one or two of those to see if they survive better.
And then we may retro-fit to places like Finchley.&equo; [/p] [p]
No loos, and Ellie's Sandwich <head>Bar</head> on Piccadilly Circus is long gone too, and, if you fancy a refreshing beverage while you're waiting (endlessly) at Sloane Square, tough luck-that platform pub has gone too, a victim of No Smoking restrictions.

But religious righteousness has been a more potent force than economic despair.
For many British Muslims, resurgent Islam is now vying for their sympathies against secular liberalism.
The Salman Rushdie affair is a vivid example. [/p] [p]
The Rushdie business drove a wedge between secular society and Muslims; it also strengthened the hold of religious leaders over their flock.
When Bradford Muslims burnt copies of &bquo;The Satanic Verses&equo; and effigies of its author, right-thinking liberals cringed; when the government refused to ban the book as blasphemous, even moderate Muslims felt insulted.

If you get a job as a shop assistant or checkout operator, one of the first things you will learn is till procedure.
There are so many different types of tills and cash registers in use today that it would be impossible to describe them all; they range from the old &bquo;press button&equo; type to modern, computerised systems.

Some basic functions [/head] [p]

The assistant simply keys in a code number, or uses a special &bquo;light pen&equo; to &bquo;read&equo; the <head>bar</head> code on the item &mdash; and the till does the rest: displays the cost of the item, and shows the amount of change needed, once the assistant has keyed in the amount given by the customer.

In program terms, we can imagine a high-level command: [quote] [p]
GIVE ME A DRINKING SENSE OF THIS WORD IF THERE IS ONE [/p] [/quote]
and the response to such a command could be to hand up some dictionary definition of a bar as a drinking place.
I am not advocating such a theory of parsing English into formal representations &mdash; I happen not to believe strongly in such &bquo;top &mdash; down&equo; theories, though there are several relatively successful ones in the literature.
The point is that there could be such a command and at the level of that command where, as it were, the answer would be received, no information would ever be received about the other senses of &bquo;<head>bar</head> &equo; that the system as a whole might happen to know about in its dictionary, and the procedures for surveying that range of senses would never be revealed.

The function of the biceps is to bend the elbow, supinate the forearm and flex the shoulder.
As with the triceps, to develop larger biceps heavy basic exercises such as barbell curls or dumb-bell curls must be performed.
Dumb-bell curls should always involve rotation of the dumbbells.
This means that the biceps have been worked through their complete range of movement, aiding complete development. [/p] [p]
Forearm training is frequently omitted because of all the work the forearms do while training other body parts.
Higher repetitions must be used because the muscle type is denser and more resilient (like the calves).
Wrist rolling is probably one of the best exercises to perform.
This involves holding out a bar at arm's length and then rotating it.
A weight can be tied to the <head>bar</head> by a piece of rope and then raised and lowered to make the exercise more difficult. [/p] [p]

Though literary festivals could be immensely enjoyable, especially if they took you to some pleasant distant city, like Toronto or Adelaide, there was something absurd about writers gathering together in this way.
We were all of us separate and self-absorbed; each one wrote what he was able to write.
The absurdity became clearer if one imagined twenty or thirty writers from another era occupying the air-conditioned coach that took us from the Hyde Park Regis to the Riverside.
Suppose &mdash; I reflected that evening &mdash; Stendhal, Lamartine, Poe, Jane Austen, Sir Walter Scott, De Quincey, Wordsworth, Coleridge, Keats, Percy and Mary Shelley, Ann Radcliffe, Leigh Hunt, Mickiewicz, Pushkin, Gogol, Goethe, and a dozen other well-known, forgettable writers were making this journey.

The child could not decide whever he wanted a chocolate bar or a scoop of ice cream: it occurred to Nelson to combine the two. [/p] [p]
After months of experimentation he came up with a vanilla ice cream bar on a stick, bonded with cocoa butter to a coating of chocolate. [/p] [p]
Initially, Nelson called this the &bquo;I-Scream&equo; bar.
This was because a slogan &mdash; which he himself coined &mdash; had been set to music and became a hit tune of the period: &bquo;I-Scream, you scream.
WE all scream.
FOR ICE CREAM!&equo; [/p] [p]
Nelson, however, feared that once the song was no longer in vogue, his product would become similarly unfashionable.
He accordingly renamed it the &bquo;Eskimo Pie&equo; and chose the distinctive Eskimo symbol that still appears on the wrapping.
The <head>bar</head> was patented and Nelson duly became president of the Eskimo Pie Corporation. [/p] [p]

But Jaroslav Rona, a member of a group of prominent artists, says: &bquo;If intellectual groups had not met in the cafes, nothing would have happened.
If the authorities had had any sense, they would have closed the cafes.&equo; [/p] [p]
Prague's cafes have been the centre of cultural activity since the days of the Austro-Hungarian empire.
So potent is the tradition of Czech cafe society, that most cafes were shut down after the Communist takeover in 1948. [/p] [p]
To prevent opposition forces coalescing, the authorities went to great length to separate the various strands of artistic and intellectual thought. [/p] [p]
Separate organisations were created for, among others, officially approved painters, writers and architects, with each group being allocated an official meeting place.
Contact between the different groups was actively discouraged. [/p] [p]
Students were not even given their own campus cafe or union <head>bar</head> to meet in.

The town is a mixture of the old and the new.
Small back streets run higgledy-piggledy back up the hill from the golden, sandy beach and the main prom, and these contain a jumble of small bars, Spanish and seafood restaurants, Bodegas with wine barrels stretching from floor to ceiling, and wonderful shops selling leather, shoes and denim at remarkable prices. [/p] [p]
In a slightly more modern area of town, but still only a short stroll away from the beach, is Lloret's West End, built around the &bquo;Queen Vic&equo;, a traditional English style pub run by our good friend Jimmy.
It's open late, and has a massive outdoor cinema screen.
Right across the road from the &bquo;Vic&equo; is Rockafellas, the Club 18&ndash;30 disco <head>bar</head> , open well into the early hours and a host of other bars and discos such as the Texas and Moby Dick's.

The Vauxhall HPC Seven is so powerful that Caterham took the unusual step of offering a high performance driving course in the price of the car (between &pound;18,200 and &pound;23,000), compulsory for the under 25s. [/p] [p]
For the past few years, Caterham has produced a new model every year, whether it be with a different engine, or new suspension or an entire new series such as the Rover K-Series.
The annual models provide good publicity at the Motor Show, but surely there is a limit to what can be done to a car that has to be instantly recognisable by its shape?
&bquo;There is a limit to everything.
No doubt we will run out of ideas one day.&equo; [/p] [p]
Caterham does not have copyright on the Seven's basic, long-bodied shape, which ran out several years ago, but it has sued companies that indulge in &bquo;passing off&equo;.
&bquo;If someone comes out with a car that looks like ours, that has the same windscreen, a roll <head>bar</head> in the same position and so on, that did not happen by accident.

It was in response to that application that the committee yesterday published its findings, which must now be digested by the Law Society before it formally applies to the Lord Chancellor for extended rights of audience. [/p] [p]
Lord Griffiths, committee chairman, said: &bquo;The major step is that clients should have the choice of being represented by the same lawyer throughout.
If the safeguards we propose are adopted, we are confident this can work as successfully as it already does in the magistrates&equo; and county courts.&equo; [/p] [p]
The committee's findings were broadly in line with what the Law Society wanted, according to Mr Peter Ely, its president, although the committee's opposition to employed solicitors appearing in higher courts went against the society's wishes. [/p] [p]
Barristers, who opposed the ending of their monopoly, were less happy with the findings of the committee.

This month I would like to continue our study of double stops by taking a look at some examples of their usage in blues playing.
The first example shown in fig 1 is a fairly typical intro idea, taken from the intro of Jimi Hendrix's [hi]Red House [/hi].
Bars 1&ndash;2 of this part rely on the intervals of thirds, sixths and flat fifths &mdash; or in other words the interval structure of the B7 and Bb7 dominant chord structures that are used.
This is then followed by some b7-root bends and a descending blues scale phrase.
Notice in this how the major 7th (A&sharp;) is used as a passing tone. [/p] [p]
Double-stops abound in nearly all aspects of blues playing.
The next example (fig 2) shows a 12 <head>bar</head> &bquo;walking bass&equo; rhythm part idea in which each bass note is followed by an open string double-stop.

Because it was a Peculiar, the priory church had four wardens &mdash; one of their duties was to enforce the wearing of woolly hats on Sundays: failure to comply brought a fine of fourpence. [/p] [p]
Adjoining the churchyard is the Buttermarket, but only in name now.
The butter booths and the fire station have been removed but the local branch of the Heritage Society has restored the old town lock-up, known as the penny cells.
Men who were drunk at market were put in these cells till sober, and then had to pay a penny to get out.
There were two tiny windows, each with one bar across originally, but friends of the prisoners delayed the sobering up process by passing jugs of ale through the windows, so two bars were fitted.
Nothing daunted, the bearers of comfort brought a flagon of ale and a long clay pipe.
They put the bowl in the ale and the stem through between the <head>bars</head> &mdash; perhaps Snaith invented drinking straws.

Niki is behind Johansson and he can't get past: Stefan's Toleman is faster on the straights and the track has few other places for overtaking.
Johansson is driving the race of his life and he knows he is in charge of the championship, even if it's not going to be his.

The worksheets themselves are organized into Notebooks which contain 257 pages each (which should be enough for most mortals). [/p] [p]
Moving cells around the sheet is done by a similar drag &bquo;n&equo; drop process, but it's less well implemented than Excel's.
Single cells can't be moved with the mouse, and ranges which are in the process of being copied or moved look identical, so you're more likely to lose track of what you're doing. [pb] [/p] [p]
On the plus side, charting capabilities are excellent &mdash; there's a vast range of graph types.
There's also an enhancing tool which lets you embellish the charts and you can even paste bitmapped images (such as a picture of your favourite car) onto parts of the graphs.

Other savings will come from increasing the power of the reactor from 1200 to 1500 MW, the use of a smaller diameter reactor vessel, a rectangular rather than cylindrical reactor building, a thinner concrete structure, fewer pipes and the possible scrapping of the system to remove very hot items of equipment from the reactor vessel.

Surrounded by the soft, rolling hills of Armadale, Moffat House is set in two acres of mature garden and has magnificent views of the Annan valley.
It is a mid-18th-century mansion built by the famous architect, John Adam, and typically consists of a main building with two connecting wings.
It is situated in the charming old spa town of Moffat, a recent winner of both the &bquo;Best Kept Village&equo; and the &bquo;Scotland in Bloom&equo; awards. [/p] [p]

The loch is so new and shallow that underwater tree-stumps can still catch you unawares.

William Greaney, an attorney for the Chemical Manufacturers Association,
said that while other appeals courts have ruled differently on whether
cleanup costs are damages, the influence of the appeals court in New York ``
will make insurers sit up and listen.'' He said the decision was the first
in which a federal appeals court has ruled whether administrative
government proceedings qualify as litigation.  Barry R. Ostrager, an
attorney for Travelers, said, ``there are procedural bases on which this
case will be appealed further.'' NEW YORK 'S poor face nearly three million
legal problems a year without legal help.  That is the conclusion of a

He also asserted that exact questions were n't replicated.  When referred
to the questions that matched, he said it was coincidental.  Mr. Kaminski,
the schoolteacher, and William Mehrens, a Michigan State University
education professor, concluded in a study last June that CAT test versions
of Scoring High and Learning Materials should n't be used in the classroom
because of their similarity to the actual test.  They devised a 69-point
scale -- awarding one point for each subskill measured on the CAT test --
to rate the closeness of test preparatives to the fifth-grade CAT.  Because
many of these subskills -- the symmetry of geometrical figures, metric
measurement of volume, or pie and <head>bar</head> graphs, for
example -- are only a small part of the total fifth-grade curriculum, Mr.
Kaminski says, the preparation kits would n't replicate too many, if their
real intent was general instruction or even general familiarization with
test procedures.

Judge Leval reluctantly concluded that a few of Mr. Miller's quotations
from Mr. Hubbard's unpublished writings, because they were not necessary to
prove historical points, failed the fair-use test and therefore infringed
copyright.  But the proper remedy, Judge Leval said, lay in a suit for
damages, not in an injunction.  The case went on appeal to the Second
Circuit.  In a decision in April of this year, Judge Roger Miner, joined by
Judge Frank Altimari, agreed on denying the injunction and did not doubt
that ``Bare-Faced Messiah'' was a serious work but rejected Judge Leval's
argument that the public interest in scholarship could outweigh the
sanctity of copyright.  ``We conclude,'' the two judges wrote, ``that

VOLUNTARISM: In an effort to stave off a plan that would require all

the state bar recommended an alternative program to increase voluntary
participation in pro bono programs.  The state bar association's policy

effectiveness before considering mandatory pro bono.  ``We believe our
suggested plan is more likely to improve the availability of quality legal

achieve that objective without the divisiveness, distraction,
administrative burdens and possible failure that we fear would accompany an

Eventually we were ready to go and K&amacr;li's load &mdash; for all her child's body &mdash; was considerably bigger than mine.
But as we made our way down through the trees, I realized that even if I'd been better at baling I could never have carried that load: my forehead hurt, my neck felt stiff and strained, and the pine-needles on the path, compressed and polished by thousands of feet, were as slippery as glass.

The philosophy of the Warnock Report (Department of Education and Science, 1978) greatly influenced the content of the 1981 Education Act, particularly with its recommendation that varying and individual educational needs should be acknowledged, rather than prejudged on the basis of categories.
It was recognised by the Warnock Committee that children with sensory impairments could indeed have special educational needs, but that these might be met within a range of different kinds of educational placements, for instance, in individual integration, in special units, or in special schools.
In addition, this committee reflected the view of many educators of visually handicapped pupils that there is no distinct cut-off point between the fully and the partially sighted, nor between the partially sighted and the <head>blind</head>in terms of functioning.

Such experiences of sexual liberation bear witness to the socially constructed &bquo;nature&equo; of identity with respect both to its contingency and its resilience: on the one hand the self can be and is experienced as radically different in the space of the other; on the other hand it the extinction of self is the precondition of passing into the ecstasy with and through the other, it is an extinction which has to be replayed over and again as a [hi]constitutive part of sexual ecstasy itself [/hi].
And if, as so oft en, ecstasy obliterates the specificity of the landscape which simultaneously enables and absorbs it, this is not only because ecstasy is of its nature <head>blind</head> ; it is also because what we repudiate remains with us as partial blindness to what we embrace in its stead.

It has become linked with the god meme because the two reinforce each other, and assist each other's survival in the meme pool. [/p] [p]
Another member of the religious meme complex is called faith.
It means blind trust, in the absence of evidence, even in the teeth of evidence.
The story of Doubting Thomas is told, not so that we shall admire Thomas, but so that we can admire the other apostles in comparison.
Thomas demanded evidence.
Nothing is more lethal for certain kinds of meme than a tendency to look for evidence.
The other apostles, whose faith was so strong that they did not need evidence, are held up to us as worthy of imitation.
The meme for blind faith secures its own perpetuation by the simple unconscious expedient of discouraging rational inquiry. [/p] [p]

His was the first attempt to explain Stalinism as an aberration through the forms of Marxist analysis itself.
Rather than reject Marxism on the grounds that it had been disproved by history, as Merleau-ponty had done, he sought to account for Stalinism through a dialectical analysis of the specific history of the Soviet Union since the Revolution: theory and practice, he argued, had become separated with the result that the former [pb] had become &bquo;sclerosed&equo; while the latter had become &bquo;<head>blind</head> &equo; and &bquo;unprincipled&equo; (I, 50).

Barraga (1976) focuses on encouraging a positive and challenging approach to the visually handicapped child's encounter with every&rehy;day surroundings, considering that most mishaps and collisions are a part of learning for future independence, since &bquo;Expanding knowledge through using the body, combined with interpretation is the key to continuous refinement in motor skills for <head>blind</head>children and youth throughout their lives.&equo;

I have never known a situation where a doe has used the same breeding stop twice.
The stop is a small burrow with only a single entrance.
It usually extends no more than 4 to 5 feet (1.2 to 1.5 metres) in length and has an enlarged breeding chamber at its far end.
Into this the doe carries dry grass, straw, and suchlike, lining her nest with fur from the belly of her own body.
Her young are born in the nest and she leaves them there, protecting them from predators by blocking the hole with soil, which she packs down quite tightly. [/p] [p]
She will then go off to her own burrow or will lie rough in ground vegetation until reopening the stop for feeding purposes.
She continues this process until the young rabbits, born <head>blind</head>and hairless, have grown fur and are in need of food she cannot supply.

To record any kind of insert, you first have to decide where it is to come within the existing recording, that is the material which is to be over-recorded and therefore lost.
Hopefully, you will have anticipated this by having shot some spare length which can be sacrificed to make room for the insert, the edit in and edit out points for which are determined with the help of the cue/review buttons. [/p] [p]
The insert procedure itself varies somewhat from model to model, but the essence of it is to arrange for the over-recording to end at a pre-determined out point.
This bit of juggling is introduced [gap] [pb] into the process because you will necessarily be working <head>blind</head>&mdash; during the recording of the insert, the camcorder viewfinder will be displaying, not a playback of the original shot, but the material which is displacing it.

Indeed, the exact timing we choose will depend upon social and work factors and the comments made earlier about &bquo;larks&equo; and &bquo;owls&equo; will be pertinent here.
For students, there is a tendency to socialize in the evenings; therefore bedtimes and rising times are fairly late.
for those who must start work early in the morning (for example, bakers or farmers who have to deal with livestock), their life-style requires them to be active earlier.
for those working in, or frequenting, nightclubs and casinos, their personal time-cues are particularly late.
Extreme examples exist when night-workers are considered, but these produce special problems that will be dealt with later. [/p] [p]
Individuals will also vary in the importance they attach to a particular time-cue.
For example, <head>blind</head>people will be unable to use light/dark changes and so will have to make more use of a regular sleep/wake rhythm or of social commitments.

One can learn a considerable amount of science from this tremendous novel &mdash; about bacteriophage, for example, the virus that attacks bacteria, which Arrowsmith discovers independently of Felix-Hubert d'Herelle in 1917.
In his biography [hi]Changing Patterns [/hi] (1968), Sir Macfarlane Burnet mentions his great interest in this section when he read the book on board ship from Australia to England in 1925.
Just as important for the general reader, though, are the scientific ideas that Lewis purveys, painlessly and entertainingly.
Above all, there is Arrowsmith and Gottleib's fanatical insistence on controls for all of their experiments.
Just as the most penetrating analysis of the human problems behind double <head>blind</head>drug trials is to be found not in any treatise of medical ethics but in John Rowan Wilson's novel [hi]The Double Blind [/hi] (1961), so the stern and rigorous standards of experimental science are uniquely illustrated in Arrowsmith.

MORE than any other woman he had met, Beatrice was able to share in Modigliani's life, and his work changed dramatically during her reign.
By 1915, Modigliani had begun to paint the portraits reproduced in every art book: Paul Guillaume, his dealer; the painter Moise Kisling; the fat child; the bride and groom.
His years as a sculptor had taught him to see the human figure in solid, three-dimensional form, and his people now have necks like columns, oval or elongated faces and noses sharply drawn, as if cut into the planes of the face.
He always began a portrait with the eyes.
And the eyes in his paintings hold the key to the psychologically charged atmosphere.
Even when they are blanks, sightless as in sculpture, they focus the attention hypnotically.
He had begun to paint some portraits with one eye &bquo;<head>blind</head> &equo;, the other seeing.

Britain managed to isolate itself in international fora &mdash; such as the 35 Nation Convention on Long Range Transboundary Air Pollution convened by the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UN ECE) &mdash; by rejecting the scientific consensus that forest decline was linked to air pollution from industry, power stations and vehicles. [/p] [p]
As the 1990s began, almost every western industrialised country was investing heavily in new rail links and traffic controls to combat growing levels of air pollution from traffic.
Britain, however, had fought to impede European [pb] agreements requiring catalytic converters on cars and even as London's traffic slowed to pre-First World War speeds, planned to build vast new roads and to cut rail services. [/p] [p]
Just as officialdom saw the legendary return of salmon to the Thames as evidence that Britain's water pollution was cured, so it gloried in the Clean Air Acts of the 1950s and turned a &bquo;<head>blind</head>eye&equo; to dying lakes, moribund trees and the links between car exhaust and human health that became apparent in the 1980s.

Since the turn of the century there have been brief periods when Britain has been more or less self-sufficient in cereals, meat, and dairy produce &mdash; during the two World Wars, and today, under the extraordinary economics of the European Community.

After an intermediate five-book stage, [hi]The Prelude [/hi] was completed in 1805 in thirteen books, including the addition of the first 271 lines at the beginning of Book i.
In many ways this text exhibits all the evidence of rapid composition, hut against this must be set its [hi]readability [/hi], making it the version now generally preferred.
Some of the additional subject-matter, such as Cambridge and the French Revolution, has already been discussed.
The poem as a whole now tells a quite different story from the two-Part version of 1799; after the period of childhood, something is lost (this sounds vague, but if it were known what was lost [hi]it would not be so [/hi]!).
To the grown man visionary experiences come infrequently, but when they do appear the effect is profound, as in &bquo;the <head>Blind</head>Beggar&equo; episode; caught in the maelstrom of London, the poet is admonished as if from another world' (see page 64).

Careful descriptions of speech are necessary because people's beliefs about their actual linguistic behaviour are often very inaccurate; many people think they speak in the same way as they write but, in fact, no one does.
Soon after our Report was published, Mr Baker took part in a radio discussion.
A letter appeared in the [hi]Independent [/hi] pointing out that he made a number of grammatical errors.
But the conventions of speech are very different from those appropriate for writing.
In a conversation we can explore meanings, often changing tense as our thought jumps from idea to idea, and we can enforce our reasoning with gesture and facial expression.
In lively talk with friends we all continually break the rules appropriate for the written form, and Mr Baker on the radio was no exception. [/p] [p]

Prescriptivists are seen as <head>blind</head>adherents to outdated norms of formal usage.

There are four related conceptual differences between epistemic and perspectival appearances: (1) Epistemic appearances are subjective, whereas perspectival appearances are objective; (2) It makes no sense to say that X appears to be &phgr; to Y but Y does not know it, whereas it does make sense to say that X presents such-and-such a perspectival appearance to the point of view Y occupies but Y does not know it; (3) X can appear to be &phgr; to Y only if Y possesses the concept &phgr;: nothing similar can be said about perspectival appearances; (4) Epistemic appearances are related to their [pb] objects by being true or false of them, whereas perspectival appearances are related to their objects mathematically.

At the same time, for those who have not arrived at, or hold back from such a step of faith, the Kingdom is not yet. [/p] [p]
Our Lord came to inaugurate the Kingdom.
As he began his ministry it was present in his person.
He represented the dawn of a new age which would never be engulfed by darkness.
His amazing words and miraculous deeds were signs of the coming Kingdom.
As his disciples were identified with him in his ministry and experienced the healing powers of the new age operating through them, so they became partakers of the Kingdom.
Wherever they went they represented a frontier of the Kingdom (Luke 10:1).
To the Pharisees, who were <head>blind</head>to the evidence before their eyes, and were postponing their hopes to the future, our Lord responded, &bquo;No one will say, &bquo;Look, here it is!&equo; or, &bquo;There it is!&equo; because the Kingdom of God is within you&equo; (Luke 17:21).

This is of course encouraging, in terms of the potential effects of disclosure regulations under the Consumer Credit Act.
But there are various snags. [/p] [p]
First, the proportion of people who remained unmoved by disclosure of credit costs and interest rates &mdash; on average, more than two-thirds of the sample &mdash; was large.
For those who did stick to their first choice, the most important consideration seems to have been simply how much they wanted &mdash; or could afford &mdash; to pay back each month.
Moreover, about eight per cent of those who changed their minds with additional disclosure changed in the Wrong' direction: they made a blind or confused choice rather than a rational decision.
<head>Blind</head>choosers must, by the rules of chance, be just as likely to make an accidentally correct [pb] choice.

Denis Diderot gained lasting fame as the energetic editor of the French [hi]Encyclopaedia [/hi], but he is also rightly celebrated as an art critic.
It was in 1761, that he first wrote an account of one of the Salons, which was circulated with his other correspondence in the fashion of the time by his friend Grimm.
Diderot's standards were those primarily of a moralist, questioning how morality might be fashioned through painting, but he was sensitive to artistic aims; his essay on painting was admired both by Goethe and Baudelaire.
Here is a description by Diderot of a Russian country scene by Le Prince, from criticism of the Salon in 1767. [quote] [p]

Even though we should now have reached beyond this view there is still lingering uncertainty as to what the world of experience and thought is when perceived through a language such as BSL.
Myklebust (1964) claimed there was an &bquo;organismic shift&equo;, at least producing a different experience of events but probably producing different thought.
If blind people's drawings of objects (more or less as they would be touched) reflected their thoughts, then deaf people's writings obviously showed a difference.
Unfortunately, both circumstances particularly highlighted skills which were difficult to acquire or monitor and could hardly act as evidence on the nature of thought.
The fact that <head>blind</head>people can talk makes their world more accessible; the fact that we can now [pb] begin to describe BSL makes it much more likely that we can get an effective picture of how sign language reflects the internal organisation of deaf people. [/p] [p]

ONE of the great advantages of villages over cities for chronic insomniacs, such as I am, is that late at night there is nothing to do in a village except read.
Sasbach was no exception and I made good progress with Pascal's [hi]Pens&eacute;es [/hi].
Perhaps almost by definition, travel, like philosophy, is for those who find themselves in some sense displaced.
The cult word would be &bquo;alienated&equo;.
Perhaps some component of Pascal's restless questioning was due to his displacement through recurrent ill-health, but what makes his questionings still worth reading, is that they confront the foundations of our existence and that despite the fact that he is sometimes seen merely as a Catholic apologist. [/p] [p]
Like Heidegger, he understands that the root of the problem is not that we are born black or Jewish or rich or <head>blind</head> , but that we are born at all and much of his best writing deals with that most fundamental of displacements.

But where this liberty was not balanced by responsibility the Reformation made man so free [hi]under [/hi] God that it was only a short step to his being free from God.
We might say that the despair of existentialism is simply the logic of atheism, but this is true only in so far as atheism itself is the logic of ungrateful Protestantism. [/p] [p]
By rejecting the excessive &bquo;form&equo; of the medieval church, the Reformation provided a strong impetus to liberty.
But in swinging almost immediately towards the opposite pole, the heirs of the Reformation indulged the West in an excessive &bquo;freedom&equo; from which its culture has yet to recover.

The capitalist &bquo;national economy&equo; has changed from an [hi]irrational [/hi] system into a [hi]rational [/hi] organisation&hellip;
This transformation has been made possible by the growth of finance capitalism and the cohesion between the economic and political organisations of the bourgeoisie.

But, of course, the problems that arise out of this interpretation are twofold.
Firstly, there is the problem of the protestant population itself in the North.
Their position as Irish people is ambiguous.
For the hard-line republican position, there is even a duality: protestant loyalists are taken as foreigners with an alien culture, and as either a pariah group &mdash; the mere instrument of British imperialism &mdash; or simply not there.
Their culture has no rights, no claim to an alternative identity.
Intellectually, [pb] the problem is the British presence in Ireland.
But emotionally, the non-people are hated or at least detested.

But again, this did not necessarily follow: the spirit of the exchange mattered too.
While grandmothers who brought cakes or made clothes for their grandchildren did so from their own choice, childcare stemmed principally from the request of mothers.
These were mostly working wives: mill or munition factory workers, cleaners or outworkers.
Grandmothers would help them by minding the children after school, cooking their dinners, and sometimes having them overnight.
Typically they lived very close by.

We can understand this more clearly if we imagine that the tables have been turned, and that we are trying to get by in basic dolphin-language.
Dolphins have a sense which we do not have: using something akin to our sonar, they can &bquo;see&equo; their surroundings holographically (in true 3D, rather than the effect of 3D our stereoscopic vision creates).
There are no words in any human language that can adequately describe the experience of &bquo;seeing&equo; something in this way &mdash; [pb] precisely because human beings do not have a holographic sense and so have never required the words to describe it nor the intellectual ability to be able to imagine it.

been for the young and daring and many baby boomers have outgrown skiing or
have too many family responsibilities to stick with the sport.  In its new

I'm Mrs [gap] and er the point I wanna make is that I understood when Jimmy Jones came here had two lovely full houses but I heard through the building through the grapevine that the members of the trust or council objected to him because he was racist his jokes and sexist.
Now if you're talking about filling the seats it's obvious that the people in Harlow like that type of thing so why don't we have more of it. [event]. [/u] [u]
The answer to that question would be that the Council's actually the Councillors adopt an equal opportunity policy and that policy now has been adopted by the theatre trust and the theatre trust wouldn't put anything on if they feel sexist or racist or ageist. [/u] [u]

Vic tried to argue that it didn't make any difference how many toilets you had, it was the number of times you flushed them that mattered, but his father was convinced that having so many toilets was an incitement to unnecessary peeing, therefore to excessive flushing. [/p] [p]
He could be right, at that.
At Gran's house, a back-to-back in Easton with an outside toilet, you didn't go unless you really had to, especially in the winter.
Their own house in those days, a step up the social ladder from Gran's, had its own indoor toilet, a dark narrow room off the half-landing that always niffed a bit, however much Sanilav and Dettol his mother poured into the bowl.
He remembered vividly that yellowish ceramic bowl with the trademark &bquo;Challenger&equo;, the big varnished wooden seat that was always pleasantly warm to the <head>bum</head> , and a long chain dangling from the high cistern with a sponge-rubber ball, slightly perished, on the end of it.

The famous film director from France could speak no English, and so Miranda was being sent to do the interview as well as provide the paper's weekly caricature; she had the address of the location, a newsagent's in the High Street of a part of the city she had never heard mentioned before, Giblett Park, though [pb] she had lived in London most of her life; the Press Office had said that he would give her ten minutes between takes, or more if she were lucky and the filming was going well and Jean-Claude Meursault was feeling mellow. [/p] [p]
The paper's usual film reporter would write the story from Miranda's notes; he'd already attended several days' shooting of the new, as yet untitled film, the first Meursault to be made in Britain, which was a supreme sign that the decade was making all the difference to the world's view of the country, and its relation to the avant-garde. [/p] [p]

About a third of these costs are met by the Church Commissioners, who generated investment income of &pound;140.8 million in 1989.
This sum met almost all the pension costs of 10,000 clergy pensioners and widows.
It also provided approximately 40% of the stipends and housing costs of the 11,500 serving clergy. [/p] [p]
Donations from the man or woman in the pew form the Church of England's other big source of income.
In 1988 (the last available figures), some 1,165,000 churchgoers (measured by usual Sunday attendance) put a total &pound;166.7 million in the plate.
This figure reflects an active drive on the part of the church to increase giving from, for example, a 1978 total of &pound;53.7 million.
The increase has outstripped inflation, but any parish priest will tell you that both the number of &bquo;<head>bums</head> on pews&equo; and the amount they donate are disappointing. [/p] [p]

Gina was annoyed by his jogging, though, that was one comfort.
She had found the price tag off the tracksuit.
It had been rather an expensive one as he had gone for a [pb] fleecy-lined designer number with flashes of blue, to match his eyes, on the shoulders and down the legs.
&bquo;You are a silly old man,&equo; she told him, &bquo;running along the road with everything jumping up and down.

&bquo;What about your lean old arse &mdash; I couldn't call it a bum in all conscience &mdash; grinding away on the saddle of your bike?&equo;
Nigel realized his verbal subtleties were probably lost on Gina.

That was 10 years ago, and bookmakers William Hill, who will give you odds of 25:1 against a runner beating a horse and rider, have yet to pay out. [/p] [p]
Notwithstanding a single impudent win by a mountain biker in 1989, it would appear that the subject is now closed.
Or is it?
Mid-Wales is horse rider's country, and local pride demands that the horse should triumph over these interlopers.
A course that mixes open pasture, bridleways, forest tracks and country lanes undeniably favours the horse.
There's simply no contest. [/p] [p]
Not that this dissuades upwards of 800 competitors from entering the event. [/p] [div2] [head]

In the second half of September the Bavarian Cultural Ministry was still in discussion with the F&uuml;rstin over what should be included in the sale, with particular efforts being made to acquire, or cause to be withdrawn, items with strong Bavarian or Regensburg connections.

This last month, the Bavarians have been going through the painful experience of learning that, where an historic collection is concerned, it is the whole which is greater than the parts, and no saving of individual items can make up for the erosion of that whole. [/p] [/div2] [div2] [head]

Indeed, the colour of your breeches is very important, at least, if the rules are anything to go by.
The BSJA rules, for example, dictate: &bquo;Breeches or jodhpurs [hi]must [/hi] be white, pale yellow or fawn colour&equo;.
You can almost hear the old majors in charge of the sport muttering &bquo;got to be properly dressed&equo;, but the next two rules concern the wearing of hard hats and only &bquo;recommend&equo; that they comply with British Standards. [/p] [p]
In other words, you could ride into the ring with a home-made hard hat that would have to be accepted if it had a &bquo;harness secured to the shell at more than two points&equo;, but they can pull you up for wearing black jodhs!
How can the colour of your <head>bum</head> be more important than the safety of your brain, unless the BSJA supports the dressage riders' theory that show jumpers are brain dead anyway? [/p] [p]

Many felt that to be denied the use of a fishing net for 4 months each year was the removal of a fundamental human right.
Slooten and Dawson were accused of fabricating their data, and of failing to count dolphins accurately. [/p] [p]
The controversy created by the research suddenly put Hector's dolphin firmly in the public eye.
Before the study began, few people knew about the dolphin, but the upsurge in public interest prompted many locals to claim that they were seeing more dolphins recently than ever before, whereas in fact they had probably just taken greater notice of something that had always been there.
Others agreed with the idea of a sanctuary, but suggested that it should be situated somewhere else where there would be no conflicts with recreational fishing, prompting Steve Dawson to draw the analogy of &bquo;putting a plaster on your <head>bum</head> to treat a boil on your forehead.&equo; [/p] [p]

Abu Khadra Street had now become Gerulot Street, but the white-stone house was still there, with its three fine, tall windows of delicate iron tracery.

Sound engineers, lighting technicians, set designers, carpenters and electricians have been working night and day, high on the adrenalin that 90 minutes of live T.V. induces.
There's a stretch-steel tension in the normally soothing make-up room, where nine intently concentrating make-up girls are tending the terrified contestants &mdash; and this is only a dress-run.
Admittedly there's an audience.
We have to try out the master scoreboard, a slick computerised monster and a change from the usual &bquo;Spaghetti Junction&equo;, so need the audience to check the theatre's voting system. [/p] [p]

His face was grotesquely puffed and had taken on the colour of dark purple.
Sandison did not even bother to check his pulse or try to revive him.
Maidstone was dead.
The old lady, following Sandison into the tiny bedroom, dropped to her knees, crossed herself and started up a high-pitched wailing, interspersed with fragments of speech which Sandison found completely incomprehensible.
He decided that the best thing for him to do was to leave as soon as possible, before other people arrived and the situation became very complicated.
After all, there was nothing he could do to help Maidstone now.
He backed out of the bedroom, leaving the old lady still on her knees before the bed.
He glanced round the small untidy sitting room and saw Maidstone's jacket on the back of a <head>chair</head> , presumably placed there by Franco.

Some ways are less obvious.
Consider a plateful of baked beans on toast.
Electricity was used to mill the flour, to bake the bread, for driving milking machines and then butter churns, to cook the beans in the factory, to mould the tin can, to make the paper for the label and to print it, and finally to heat the beans and make the toast.
Coal was used to smelt the steel for the tinplate and petrol to transport all the parts and goods.

A premature release of the story in London, picked up by the BBC World Service and the news wire services, led to the University of Utah being inundated with eager news reporters for the press conference.
Television cameras, radio microphones and hundreds of fascinated spectators brought to remote Utah the sort of attention usually reserved for an important visiting head of state in Washington or New York. [/p] [p]

Her pleasure was, however, short lived.
Like all good stories unearthed by such lady editors, it was snatched away from her, and, barring wars and acts of God, as Donny O'Brien reported to Mr Pascall, the bookseller, it would be a front-page headline on Monday.
It was, therefore, no quiet lady columnist to whom Mrs Stych opened the door that evening, but an eager male reporter keen on a front-page story. [/p] [p]

During a study of the various styles, it became apparent to me that if the back legs are set into the seat rails at an angle, this angle, together with the curvature of the rear legs and backward slope of the chair back can regulate the flair: if the legs are mounted at right angles to the rear seat rail, there would be no flair.
Increasing this angle increases the flair very sensitively, up to the maximum deflection of the curve of the rear leg, if it were to be (impractically!) mounted in the plane or the rear seat rail. [/p] [p]
The requirement for robustness also demands that there be leg braces to create a strong rectangle around the rear seat joint, the point of maximum strain in all chairs.
Anyone who has had to reglue chairs will be painfully aware of this fact.
A crossmember between these two braces helps; people frequently put their legs back under their chair seats, and a cross brace between the front legs would be in the way. [/p] [p]
The above design conclusions have profound implications for the construction details of my <head>chair</head> .

Here, the argument is presented that conceptual levels of understanding are necessary precursors to the emergence of spoken language, since language is, in effect, the linguistic realisation of those conceptual distinctions already established at a non-verbal level.
When conceptual distinctions are expressed in language they are referred to as [hi]semantic [pb] relations [/hi].
While emphasising the interdependence between semantic expres&rehy;sions and underlying cognitive concepts, this approach also implies that not all of a child's understanding of a particular experience may be expressed in language, and that a child may [hi]intend [/hi] to express more than she is actually able to encode formally in language structures.
For example, Chapter 1 discussed the ways in which researchers have introduced the notion of a &bquo;rich interpretation&equo; of utterances such as &bquo;sweater <head>chair</head> &equo;, &bquo;Daddy car&equo; in order to disambiguate alternative meanings. [/p] [p]

Number the children into two equal teams and call two players.
There are then two ways to proceed.
For younger children, one way is to have hockey sticks made of two rolled-up newspapers placed either side of a ball which is put in the middle of the room.
The two players whose numbers have been called pick up the hockey sticks, and the first one to hit the ball gets the point.
For older children, make goals at either end of the room out of <head>chair</head> legs and give the point to the first person to score. [/p] [/div3] [/div2] [div2] [head]

The Committee even considered the possibility that the occupant of the Chair be given a cut-off button or that other devices be employed to override demonstrations or disturbance in the galleries or on the floor of the House, but it rejected such innovations.
It did not want any kind of disorder to be filmed, including unparliamentary behaviour by Members (or even Members trying to attract attention by wearing fancy dress or clothes bearing slogans), and it therefore recommended that in all cases of disruption or disorder the director should cut to wide-angle shots, which would not show the offending incident, or to the occupant of the Chair. [/p] [p]
In practice, the rules regarding the treatment of incidents of serious disorder remain largely untested, as there were few such occasions during the experiment.
The Committee was satisfied that minor incidents of misconduct or defiance of the <head>Chair</head> had been well handled by the directors within the rules.

It was all off the top of my head.
I had some notes jotted down on a card somewhere, but I quickly went off them and chatted about whatever seemed interesting.
(I've done dozens of lectures now, in front of all sorts of people, and I always make it up as I go along, although I suppose I must have a rough idea about what I'm going to say.)
When I thought I'd run out of things to say I asked the front two rows to move back and the whole place started buzzing.
It was Dawn's turn.
They knew I was going to attempt a display.
There was one kid, however, who didn't move back as far as the rest of his row, so I politely asked him to get in line.
Well, there's always one.

Although certainly no fan of Guns N'Roses and their offensive lyrics, I am pleased that he has spoken about the still largely-hidden subject of male sexual assault.
It is important that men feel able to discuss this issue and not experience ridicule and smug responses from so-called enlightened magazines such as yours.
Comments such as &bquo;a history of childhood abuse is both hip and horrible, the rock'n'roll statement with knobs on&equo; do not encourage other men to discuss the issue, nor do they treat this subject with the seriousness it deserves.

Kneeling can also be used to help the patient get up from the floor; most patients are taught to do this once they can walk, in case they have a fall.

The idea of entitlement probably represents an attempt, during a much longer debate about the need for a &bquo;national&equo; curriculum, to bring into focus the child's individual needs and rights: it is needed to counterbalance any propensity towards the state's collective needs &mdash; totalitarianism if you will &mdash; which a move towards a nationally prescribed curriculum might bring with it. [/p] [p]
Of course debate about the National Curriculum has been around a lot longer, but its popularisation and public debate is a relatively recent phenomenon.
It was a &bquo;secret garden&equo; at least to David Eccles who when Secretary of State for the second time, in 1962, was determined (against the better judgement of many of its guardians) to strip it of its secrecy.
Eccles' vehicle for clearing the garden's secrecy was the Schools Council &mdash; not a very efficient or fast-moving garden Rotavator.
When James Callaghan accelerated the debate in 1976, the quality of discussion was indeed raised, in what turned out to be the Schools Council's declining years, under the combined influence of the <head>Chair</head> , John Tomlinson, and the Secretary, John Mann.

I had telephoned various nursing homes in the vicinity whose staff would, I thought, be more conversant with these vagaries of conduct, but they were all full up and I'd been starting to feel desperate.
But, hosannas in the highest, all was now well. [/p] [p]
The move itself could have been worse &mdash; but not much.
However, everyone has experienced it, though not, I dearly hope, in the same circumstances.
I had sold the contents of the cottages to the incoming purchaser, as well as several large pieces from the melin which would have been quite out of place in a modern house.
Owing to the scale of the former, artefacts needed to be the size of pantomime props to appear remotely in proportion, and I had acquired them accordingly. [/p] [p]

In fact, he instinctively stepped backwards into the plantation as the car door was thrown open.
Without moving he watched McQuaid struggle from the car and then stand leaning on the open door as if waiting for someone to appear.
He could have called out from where he stood but he did not.
McQuaid slammed the car door and walked towards the house.
Not until he was several minutes within the house did Moran leave the plantation.
He came slowly and deliberately across the fields to the back door.
Though he had lived for weeks for this hour he now felt a wild surge of resentment towards McQuaid as he came into his own house. [/p] [p]

When planning your excursions in Madeira, let the morning sun be your guide in deciding whether you go east or west because it is quite common for one part of the island to bask in sunshine while another is cloudy.
The weather is one thing we cannot plan for as, although Madeira enjoys a good climate all year round, you must remember it is a small island in the Atlantic Ocean. [/p] [p]
Given the topography of Madeira, it is understandable that the island roads are full of twists and turns, climbing and descending all the time.
If you are hiring a car in the island, you will need three to four days to cover most of the main roads and to savour some of the breathtaking views.
There are various maps to show you the way, and we recommend you take a picnic with you, as most viewpoints also have picnic tables and <head>chairs</head> and space to pull your car off the road.

At the meeting which adopted the constitution, Ken Banks of AUEW TASS was added to the executive committee; he was close to the CPNI, although not actually a member.

He led Corbett into the kitchens, a cook brought him ale and a dish of meat and vegetables.
When he had eaten, Selkirk returned and tossed his possessions at him; Corbett gathered them up and followed Selkirk up rows of steps and into a small, darkened chamber. [/p] [p]
At the far end, in a pool of light thrown by sconce-torches and a cluster of candles, sat a small, balding figure swathed in robes whom Corbett recognised as Wishart, Bishop of Glasgow.
He looked up as Corbett entered.
&bquo;Come in, Master Clerk,&equo; he called, throwing down the manuscript he had been studying.
&bquo;Come, Sir James, a stool for our guest!&equo;
Corbett sat while the Bishop poured him a cup of mulled, spiced wine; Selkirk sat alongside him, lounging in a <head>chair</head> .

He secured a council house for my parents, with a garden that butted up to his own, and I enjoyed a sublime if insular childhood, basking in the adoration of my shy parents and doting grandparents. [/p] [p]

Nothing looks worse, and does a poorer job, than a worm which has been stuck on the hook several times and looks as though it has been tied in a knot.
Fish do not find worms that look like that and hooks lose so much of their penetrating power. [/p] [p]
I cast and make sure the worm lands three or four yards further than the baited area, which allows me to pull it back to the swim and sink the line at the same time.
I repeat the action with the other rod, only this time there is a large piece of flake pulled from a new loaf on the size 2 hook. [/p] [p]

Second only to the Royal Saloons of this time were the 57ft saloons de luxe, built for the accommodation of the Royal suite, when the King and Queen were travelling; when they were not required for this purpose they could be hired.
The compartments, or rooms, were decorated in white enamel, the corridor in fumed mahogany.
The body was divided into two small and one large compartments, which could be divided in the centre by folding doors.
For night travelling, brass bedsteads with handsome eiderdown quilts were provided.
The floors were covered with green figured Wilton pile carpet laid on grey felt throughout the saloon, except in the attendant's compartment and balconies. [/p] [p]
When used for day service, the furnishing comprised three easy chairs, upholstered in green and gold tapestry, one oval centre table in mahogany with inlay of tulip wood and satin wood and two folding side tables.

Mr Gorman recently trained to become a chiropractor. [/p] [p]
The basic principle of his chair is that the knees should be below the pelvis, a quite different principle to the design of most chairs.
The usual type of chair puts an enormous strain on the spine, back muscles and many of the internal organs.
Anyone sitting down for extensive periods (as we all had to do in our school days) would have to tense many of the body's muscles in order to sit up straight.
This, in turn, causes the organs, the bones and, ultimately, the entire system to be under stress. [pb] [/p] [p]
The forward-tilting chair allows the spine and the postural muscles to support and balance the body naturally.
You can easily see the effect by placing a telephone book under each of the rear legs of a ordinary kitchen <head>chair</head> .

The group had had numerous discussions about whether or not they should have a rotating chairperson, some people arguing fiercely that we shouldn't imitate male structures, that we were developing genuinely new ways of relating, conducting political discussions; we must all learn to be more sensitive, not interrupt each other, not talk for too long.
Everyone would nod.
Others in the group argued that up to a point all those things were right, but that often a subject was complex, often it could be constructive for everyone to have a chairperson who would guide discussion, not control it, who would be able to be supportive when someone talked too much or too little.
We should [pb] develop or modify existing structures as well as work out new ones.
Everyone would nod. [/p] [p]
The result was an uneasy compromise, in which for some meetings there would be a chairperson, in others not.
It depended on whether one of the pro-chairperson people suggested it.

The DHAC had proved that new and imaginative methods of protest could make an impact on the Unionist administration at the Guildhall, but for most opponents of the Unionist Party in Derry this was a reason for achieving a greater degree of anti-Unionist unity in order to press home their advantage, not to become equally [pb] hostile to the Nationalist Party.
This was shown by the first major DHAC protest following the 5 October 1968 demonstration, when the committee supported an NILP delegation to the council on the housing issue.
There was uproar when the council refused to hear the delegation and the meeting was adjourned, the Unionists withdrawing but the Nationalists remaining in their seats.
Eamonn Melaugh went over to the mayor's chair and sat down.
He shouted to the protesters: &bquo;I ask you citizens of Derry, do you approve of a crash programme of 2,000 houses?&equo;
There were cries of &bquo;yes&equo;.
They also approved his call for an extension of the boundary and he commented, &bquo;This is democracy.&equo;

My own taste for formal furniture tends to fall between the &bquo;Arts and Crafts&equo; and &bquo;Modern&equo;, rather than &bquo;Repro&equo;, and yet looking at modern designs you see in exhibitions, I doubt their &bquo;long-sit&equo; comfort and, personally, I feel that the limits of acceptable elegance are frequently passed by many, in the cause of being different.
The demand for elegance carries with it the requirement to fit in with existing furniture and although talking points can be useful, a table surrounded by a set of such chairs could be a positive eyesore.
Talking to professional designer-producers confirms this point: people will stop to admire such designs, but many more &bquo;traditional&equo; products are purchased. [/p] [p]
So we can put some limits on the project: the <head>chairs</head> must be upholstered; modern in the simplicity of their lines but not &bquo;Cubist&equo; for want of a better term; easy on the eye and bottom; they should fit in with other existing furniture; and naturally should be of strong construction so that they will be heirloom quality.

This needs to be placed at the angle which gives the best support for the material being used in relation to the pupil's vision, and some initial experimenting with different angles of work may be needed in order to settle on this.
A desk with an adjustable sloping top is useful as it provides storage space too, but probably the most practical aid, especially as the pupil progresses into secondary school, is a light, portable reading stand that can be easily taken from room to room as required.
It will need to have a ledge to support the reading material and strong clamps to hold pages in place are useful.
The earlier a pupil is able to find and keep to a comfortable and efficient working position, the better. [/p] [p]
Another factor in the pupil's near environment that can affect the comfortable use of vision for work is the &bquo;fit&equo; of the furniture (<head>chair</head> , desk, table) in terms of individual requirements.

The shaky market received its biggest jolt last month from Campeau Corp.,
which created its U.S. retailing empire with junk financing.  Campeau
developed a cash squeeze that caused it to be tardy on some interest
payments and to put its prestigious Bloomingdales department-store chain up
for sale.  Now, dozens of corporations, including Ethan Allen, TW Services
and York International, that are counting on at least $7 billion of
scheduled new junk financings to keep their highly leveraged takeovers and
buy-outs afloat, may never get the money.  ``The music has stopped playing,''
says Michael Harkins, a principal in the investment firm of Levy Harkins.
``You 've either got a <head>chair</head> or you do n't.''

He does n't fully succeed, although Mr. Straszheim lists an array of
interest-rate scenarios.  In a chilly conference room at Alliance Capital
Management in Minneapolis, in contrast, the firm's money managers seem
ready to pin Mr. Straszheim to the wall.  Alfred Harrison, the manager,
shoves Mr. Straszheim's handout back at him: ``Do we want to go through this?
Or can we ask you why you changed your forecast just when it's about to be
right?'' Swiveling in his <head>chair</head>, Mr. Straszheim replies

Mrs. Stinnett says she never believed in ghosts before, but lately her
vacuum cleaner turned itself on, a telephone flew off its stand, doors
slammed inexplicably, and she heard footsteps in her empty kitchen.  ``I
was doing the laundry and nearly broke my neck running upstairs to see who
was there, and it was nobody,'' she says, eyes wide at the recollection.
Mr. Baker hears her out, pokes around a bit, asks a few questions and
proposes some explanations.  Of the self-starting vacuum cleaner, he says:
``Could be Cuddles, -LCB- Mrs. Stinnett's dog -RCB-.'' The flying telephone:

To help do this, Mr. Palmer developed a portable massage chair three years
ago that he hopes will bring ``structured touching'' into mainstream America.
``The culture is not ready to take off its clothes, lie down and be touched
for an hour for $45,'' he says.  ``The idea is to keep the clothes on and
to keep people seated.  The chair is a way to package massage.'' Sitting in
one of Mr. Palmer's chairs, which cost $425 and have since been copied by
others, is a bit like straddling a recliner.  Customers lean forward, rest
their knees on side supports and bury their face in padding on the back of

to give the specific contributions to the $50 million guarantee from each

Mr. Soule says his only beef was that the massages were being given in a
company conference room; the department's supervised health facility would
have been fine.  ``In my view, -LCB- massages -RCB- should be managed with

attitudes, some corporate masseurs prefer to go about their business quietly.

unbeknownst to the company's executives.  He visits the same department

Leaks are relatively easy to fix if you can find their source.
A garden hose is useful here to help.
There are many places Land Rovers leak.
If the leak is high up, then it is probably the roof to gutter joint which is sealed from new and, as the sealer ages, it allows water to enter the vehicle.
Resealing with white mastic in the joint will stop water ingress at this point.
The window runners are replaced by finding the screws which hold the channel down and unscrewing them.
This is usually easier said than done as they rust and are difficult to find.

This is where the EC83/12AX7 valve does its stuff.
There are two overdrive modes, OD1 and OD2 (just like the JMP-1 MIDI preamp, which obviously shares much of the S80's technology), selected by a push switch alongside the boost channel gain pot.
OD1 is a fatter, bluesy type distortion while OD2 gives you rock distortion to full metal mayhem. [/p] [p]
The EQ section is a standard bass, middle and treble setup but a fourth pot, labelled &bquo;Contour&equo;, shifts the midrange voicing, and this is really effective in colouring the tone of both overdrive modes.
The last control on this channel is a volume pot which enables it to be balanced with the Normal channel. [/p] [p]

Channel shares had varied somewhat over the years, quite apart from the changes caused by the introduction of BBC2 and Channel 4 (Table 6.18).
Regardless of fluctuations, BBC1 reflected closely the class composition of the population as a whole; ITV had a working-class skew right from the start; all channels (especially ITV had a female skew; and all had an age profile considerably older than the population as a whole (in the 1970s, on the other hand 5 &mdash; 14 year olds had watched the most).

Ownership Tough restrictions on cross-media ownership will prevent national newspaper owners holding more than a 20 per cent stake in television companies, with a similar limitation on cross interests between commercial televison, satellite television and national radio channels.

Dolphins have suddenly appeared to help fight off a shark attack, and they frequently guide boats through storms or treacherous waters.
Yvonne Vladislavich was on a cabin cruiser that was caught by a wave and sank off Mozambique.
She swam for 40 km (25 miles) in the shark-infested Indian Ocean, but she had cut her foot and she saw half a dozen sharks trailing her.
As the sharks circled closer, two dolphins appeared at her side and protected her until she reached a buoy and could climb up onto it to safety. [/p] [p]
Another report tells of a Mrs Yvonne Bliss who fell off a boat in the West Indies.
She describes how a porpoise appeared and guided her so that she was being carried with the tide, and then helped her to a section of shallow water.
As soon as she was safe her rescuer &bquo;took off like a streak on down the <head>channel</head> &equo;. [/p] [/div3] [div3] [head]

Far down below us, out of sight, a scoop burrows through the earth, lifting a single drill at a time.
This autumn the ground is so dry that most of the earth falls away through the gaps in the conveyor-belts, but the digger cannot distinguish between potatoes, stones and potato-sized clods of mud, and the whole lot are delivered aloft, along two belts made of metal rods. [/p] [p]
At the back of the machine, on our level, an ingenious device separates out most of the stones: a circular rubber pad revolves below brushes, which are stiff enough to sweep the potatoes off into their special channel, but not rigid enough to dislodge the stones until later. [/p] [p]

Although the Channel Tunnel Company set up during the 1880s survived the abandonment of the project, the pro-tunnel lobby had little success over the next 40 years despite a rash of Bills in Parliament and an inquiry by the Committee of Imperial defence in 1913.
However, the difficulties of transferring men and materials to France during the war, and the realisation that the Channel was unlikely to remain an inviolable defence in modern times, led to a revival of interest.
By 1920 the English <head>Channel</head>Tunnel Company's scheme for a rail tunnel between Shakespeare Cliff and Sangatte was at an advanced stage of development and had attracted the support of MPs, businessmen and engineers who saw it as a major work of postwar reconstruction which would provide badly needed employment at a time of recession.

Bandwidth is also limited by the performance of the terminations at the end of the fibre.
Although in theory the bandwidth of a light link can approach infinity, in practice all lasers, photo receptors and digital conversion circuits have a finite bandwidth of operation.
There is a limit to how fast they can operate.
Also the faster they operate the more expensive they are.
Any shift of frequency, for instance, as the laser is driven hard into high frequency switching.
creates scatter in the fibre and reduces bandwidth.
The problem is worse with LEDs. [/p] [p]
In practice, it is possible to send a single digitally encoded TV channel only down an optical fibre.
This has generated some confusing comparisons between the capability of optical fibre and coaxial cables.
You can say that optical fibre is able to carry only one TV <head>channel</head>whereas a coaxial cable can carry up to 30.

It follows that LTP cannot achieve the maximum strength of which a synapse is capable: the potential for a further short-term increase is always held in reserve.
Mossy fibres terminate in the stratum lucidum of area CA3, a subfield devoid of NMDA receptors.
Consistent with this observation, LTP in mossy fibres is not blocked by the NMDA antagonist AP5 (ref. 163); moreover, it appears to be nonassociative.
The projection is technically difficult to study, and the locus and cellular mechanisms of mossy fibre LTP remain controversial.
Finally, an input-specific AP5-resistant component of LTP has been described in area CA1 [hi]165 [/hi].
The effect is small, develops gradually, is blocked by Ca [hi]2+ [/hi] <head>channel</head>antagonists, and requires stronger tetanic stimulation for its induction than is needed for NMDA receptor-dependent LTP. [/p] [p]

Fortune for the moment seemed to be favouring the French.
A second attempt by Admiral Rodney to attack the transports at Le Havre had found the defences there too strong for his bomb-vessels to get within range, while a storm off Dunkirk had enabled a French squadron shut up in the port to make its escape.
The very night that this news reached London, however, 16 October, a far more sensational despatch arrived from Canada, reporting General Wolfe's capture (during which he was fatally wounded) of Quebec, the decisive [pb] event in the loss by the French of their North American colonies. [/p] [p]

Rather than knobs, Boogie have opted for increment/decrement &bquo;touch&equo; switching for the TriAxis, and although this might not seem particularly &bquo;rock'n'roll&equo;, most of the functions are as familiar as those on your average stack.
For instance, we have gain, treble, middle and bass, drives for Lead 1 and 2 modes plus master volume and presence controls, and one other control called Dynamic Voice.
Dynamic Voice is neat because it simulates the classic &bquo;V&equo; of a graphic EQ and the V can be made deeper or more shallow by use of the preamp's up or down keys.
It can be included in the sound or not, just like the graphic on a regular Boogie combo.
Of course it's the Enter/Exit, Program/ <head>Channel</head>buttons, the LED windows, all those other LEDs and the unit's general knoblessness and facelessness (until turned on) which tells you the TriAxis is not your average bit of kit. [/p] [p]

On the northern Hebrides slope the sediment apron is up to 200 metres thick and is composed largely of an amalgamated sequence of mound-shaped mass-flow deposits.
These consist of debris-flows composed of unsorted stony sands and clays with turbidite sands and muds: they are resedimented glaciomarine deposits from the ice-margin front.
The accumulation of debris flows in this area has caused the shelf-edge to have prograded seawards up to 5 kilometres in places. [/p] [p]
On the lower part of the northern Hebrides Slope and in the basin plain of the northern Rockall Trough the debris flows are buried beneath a cover of mud that was derived from the glacier front, together with drop-stones that melted out of icebergs drifting in the area.

There the nematocysts are arranged in symmetrical rows, correctly orientated for discharge against the sea slug's enemies.

One clear difference between human and dolphin perception is that because of the ability of sound waves to penetrate objects, the dolphin can listen and &bquo;see&equo; through things.
A dolphin &bquo;listening&equo; to another dolphin can hear inner information with a kind of X-ray vision &mdash; body contours can be heard diffusely, teeth and bone reasonably well, and those parts containing air very distinctly.

Cabin air goes through the wheel wells when the gear is down, through a heat exchanger to wing fuel when aloft.
Deicing is by the (British) TKS &bquo;weeping wing&equo; system.

The next generation of chips, which the company could fit in existing digital sets, will offer selective zoom, still pictures, and multistandard operation.
A frame store could freeze any moment of the action on screen, and display it as a still picture.
The zoom control would allow the viewer to enlarge any area of the picture displayed.
And because the signals inside the television are in digits, it is of no consequence to the circuits whether the input is the US standard 525-line or the European 625 lines.
So a single set can cope with either standard. [/p] [p]
It is also relatively easy to double the number of lines displayed to improve definition, or to double the number of picture frames displayed every second to eliminate flicker.

Outboard switches?
Yes, well, these comprise a group of four jack sockets on the back, and constitute a clever move on Boogie's part.
They're basic open/close switch sockets and each can switch a piece of outboard gear.
For instance, you've decided to run the TriAxis through a couple of Boogie combos (sorry, I've just spent &pound;4,500 for you!).

Eventually, a more suitable location was sought and the company has gone from strength to strength ever since. [/p] [p]
Of late, the Laney range has focused on solid state technology to fuel its best-selling Linebacker range, resisting the current fetish for sticking a single valve into the preamp section in an attempt to provide the best of both worlds.

This chain of events led to British support of NATO becoming the basis of her Second Pillar of grand strategy, but it was to be another four years, and under Churchill's last Administration, before it was finally set in concrete with the extension of the Brussels Treaty in the October 1954.
Britain pledged herself to keep BAOR, comprising four divisions, and RAF (Germany) on the Continent in order to assuage French fears of German rearmament, which the extended Treaty now authorized.

Balancing the master volume against the power amp's levels will have some effect on the sound so, again, I settled for about half-way, with the CF-200 feeding a pair of Celestion-loaded Proamplifier 2x12 cabinets. [/p] [p]
At low output all three channels put out some very convincing sounds.
The clean channel ranges from a sparkle to a dark, deep and warm tone &mdash; exactly what I'd expect from a solid state clean channel.
The mid seems a little biased towards the upper part of the frequency band and at low level that also adds bite to the top end, creating a good, solid midrange tone. [/p] [p]
Crunch exhibits exactly that, although a certain amount of brittleness does get in the way of the smooth, valve-based sound I tend to prefer.
EQ'ing helps, but I found that over-correction would affect the lead <head>channel</head> , which shares the same tone circuitry, so I had to accept a compromise for my crunch sound. [/p] [p]

But it is unlikely that rises in Ca [hi]2+ [/hi] of this duration are necessary for the induction of LTP in view of the demonstration that LTP can still be induced even if the duration of the post-tetanic rise in Ca [hi]2+ [/hi] is restricted to less than 3s, using a photo-activatable caged Ca [hi]2+ [/hi] chelator.
Complementary data have come from combining Ca [hi]2+ [/hi] imaging with whole-cell recording.
Although, for technical reasons, LTP could not be induced, this preparation allowed Ca [hi]2+ [/hi] signals to be correlated directly with the synaptic response.
Strong tetanic stimulation, which evoked large NMDA receptor-mediated synaptic currents, produced Ca [hi]2+ [/hi] transients lasting only a few seconds.
This combination of techniques has also enabled the Ca [hi]2+ [/hi] signal that permeates NMDA channels on dendritic spines to be detected (Fig. 2). [/p] [p]

Not so Pearson and Virgin's entrenched rivals.
They are keenly aware that these forays are the latest signs that British broadcasting is becoming increasingly commercial &mdash; and competitive. [/p] [p]
The change is most splashy in radio.
Mr Branson won the eight-year franchise last April with a bid of &pound;1.9m.
The commercial-radio sector prays that he will be its saviour.
Despite having grown from 33 local stations in 1980 to more than 100 now, commercial radio's share of advertising spending has stayed stuck at 2%.
Local operators hope that, if national commercial radio takes off, some cash will trickle down to them. [/p] [p]
For that to happen Virgin 1215 will need to be a hit.
Mr Branson has no intention of being a Classic FM, which as a classical-music <head>channel</head>has limited appeal.

Assuming that the system is based on a common 8-bit Z80 microprocessor, the ADC should be allocated a unique I/O address (chosen so as to avoid conflict with other I/O devices which may be present).
Reading the data from the ADC is then a relatively simple matter of executing a port input instruction (this has the form IN A, (port) where port is the address of the ADC.
In a practical system, the &bquo;data available&equo; output of the ADC chip is used to generate an interrupt request (via the active-low IRQ line). [gap] [ptr][pb] [/p] [caption] [p]

He aims to grab 8% of the audience by offering more music and less talk, thereby attacking the BBC's Radio One, which has recently offered more talk and less music.

At first it was just the driver's door, but now the other side doors are starting to leak.
I have added stick-on stuff and silicone sealer with no success.

Any ideas?
Also, how easy is it to replace the window runners on the doors and rear body? [/p] [p]
Leaks are relatively easy to fix if you can find their source.
A garden hose is useful here to help.
There are many places Land Rovers leak.
If the leak is high up, then it is probably the roof to gutter joint which is sealed from new and, as the sealer ages, it allows water to enter the vehicle.
Resealing with white mastic in the joint will stop water ingress at this point.
The window runners are replaced by finding the screws which hold the <head>channel</head>down and unscrewing them.

Any remaining doubts about the industry's ability to compete effectively with the tunnel may be dispelled if the results of recent research from the London Business School (published in the journal Economic Policy) are to be believed.
This suggests that a 20%percnt; reduction in ferry costs through new manning arrangements and the use of larger ships would reduce the profitability of the Tunnel to zero in 1994; a reduction of 40%, which is within the bounds of possibility, would produce a &pound;4bn loss.
In view of the financial vulnerability of the project, the researchers argue that the most efficient solution would be for the governments to re-purchase the franchise once the Tunnel has been built and run the operation at marginal cost.
However, such an outcome seems highly unlikely in the present political climate. [/p] [/div2] [div2] [head]

That a regular unit was in use, which differs from the Continental value, reflects a centralised authority and even, perhaps, that the bearers of the balances were official representatives of the court, which would point to the destiny of the gold; the possibility that the gold coins found in Sutton Hoo mound 1 were a royal weight standard has been suggested (Spratling 1980).
The distribution of the balances and gold coin mirrors the areas in which goldworking was most common.

These results indicate that calmodulin affinity chromatography can be used to purify the cGMP-gated channel complex from ROS membranes and that the 240K channel-associated polypeptide binds calmodulin in a Ca [hi]2+ [/hi] -dependent manner.
On the basis of these findings, calmodulin modulation of the channel activity is likely to occur through Ca [hi]2+ [/hi] -dependent interaction of calmodulin with the 240K channel-associated protein.
The molecular identity of the 240K protein is not yet known.

Here we report that calmodulin, a Ca [hi]2+ [/hi] -binding protein present in the rod outer segment, increases the apparent Michaelis constant of the channel for cGMP.
This results in a decrease in the rate of cation influx into the rod outer segment by two- to sixfold at low cGMP concentrations and has the effect of increasing the sensitivity of the channel to small changes in cGMP levels during phototransduction.
Biochemical studies indicate that calcium-calmodulin binds to a protein of [hi]M [/hi] [hi]r [/hi] 240K which is tightly associated with the channel.
On the basis of these studies, Ca [hi]2+ [/hi] is suggested to play a central role in photorecovery and light adaptation, not only by regulating guanylate cyclase, possibly through recoverin, but also by modulating the cGMP-gated <head>channel</head>through calmodulin interaction with the 240K protein.

The ignorance with which the outsiders set about overturning a perfectly satisfactory agricultural economy at Axholme suggests parallels with the notorious ground-nut scheme instigated in East Africa in the late 1940s.
In addition, the villagers of the north-west of the region complained, with justification, that the engineering works had simply sent the water down to flood [hi]them [/hi] out.
After much legal deliberation, the lord president of the Council of the North, the earl of Strafford, pronounced that Vermuyden must bear the cost of a major new channel, still called &bquo;Dutch River&equo;, to rectify the situation.
The project ended in financial disaster, and Vermuyden was temporarily imprisoned for not paying his debts.
Catastrophic floods inundated the region in 1636 and again in 1697, exacerbated no doubt by deliberate sabotage by the commoners, but also caused by the insufficient capacity of the new <head>channels</head>and by peat shrinkage.

As a matter of course, many will protest about shipping and flying civilian plutonium around the world in large volumes.
Terrorists will not be among them.
Some of the planned MOX factories will probably fail to get approval; reactors will be refused licences to load MOX into their cores.
In Germany and Japan, where reprocessing nuclear waste has been a requirement, using the plutonium produced seems less popular; several utilities are having difficulty securing licences to burn MOX.
A projection that tries to take account of some of these factors sees civil plutonium stocks growing to 265 tonnes by 2010. [/p] [ptr][caption]

Some general managers of state radio stations are former NBC men or women accustomed to thinking in a national as well as a local context.
Their concerns now became far more parochial and ethnic, and party considerations undoubtedly began to play a greater part.
The new system definitely means a reduction in employee mobility: appointments and promotions in state stations are frequently politically and ethnically motivated, and the chances of success for local people are greater than for those from other states.
This was less often the case under the NBC.
The state governments, of whatever party, attach great importance to the expansion of their own mass media facilities.

OD1 is a fatter, bluesy type distortion while OD2 gives you rock distortion to full metal mayhem. [/p] [p]

Channel, which will offer instructional programming for teachers and school
administrators and will be supported by advertising.  Whittle has met some
resistance.  The Educational Network, as Mr. Whittle has named the three
programs, has been offered to 1,290 school districts and Whittle continues
to negotiate with 919 districts.  About 10 % of the school districts
approached have rejected the network.  Mr. Whittle said that so far, three
of the six schools that carried the program in a five-week test last spring
have subscribed to the program.  One of the test schools, Withrow High
School in Cincinnati, rejected the project.  John Bruner, associate
director of communications for Cincinnati Public Schools, said
<head>Channel</head> One was rejected because students watching the
program did n't fare particularly better on a 28-question current events
quiz than a control school without the program and school absences were

Time argues that in joining up with Tele-Communications, Viacom has
potentially more power, particularly since Viacom also owns cable networks
MTV, VH-1 and Nick at Nite.  Ironically, Tele-Communications and Time have
often worked closely in the cable business.  Together, they control nearly
40 % of Turner Broadcasting Systems Inc.; Tele-Communications has a 21.8 %
stake, while Time Warner has a 17.8 % stake.  But since Time's merger with
Warner Communications Inc., relations between the two have become strained.
Each company worries that the other is becoming too powerful and too
vertically integrated.  Meanwhile, some legal observers say the
Tele-Communications investment and other developments are weakening Viacom
's antitrust suit against Time.  Viacom accuses Time in its suit of
refusing to carry Showtime or a sister service, The Movie

happily agreed, sliding over the fact that California's roads and bridges
are n't funded by property taxes but by state and federal gasoline taxes.
Both have been raised at least 30 % in recent years, even while the price
of gasoline has fallen.  Dragging Prop. 13 into this story is a pretty long

Analysts pointed to reports that the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries is producing substantially more than its official limit of 20.5
million barrels a day, with some accounts putting the 13-nation group's
output as high as 23 million barrels a day.  That level of production did
n't take its toll on futures prices for the fourth quarter, when demand is
traditionally strong.  But because first-quarter demand is normally the
weakest of the year, several market participants say, OPEC production will
have to decline to keep prices from eroding further.  The group plans to
meet in a month to discuss production strategy for early 1990.  With prices

[/p] [p]
It is interesting that the jurist's first reaction is to appeal to analogies elsewhere in the law.
He goes on to support this with an appeal to the testator's intention, but it is a relatively modest one.
The concept of the testator's intention is used merely to establish the likely meaning attached by him to the words, and this is a technique applied as much in civil-law dispositions as in trusts.

Even the Crowther Report was not wholly free from doubts and worries: it documented the waste of talent in the system, with only 12 per cent of each age group remaining in full-time education to the age of seventeen, and a meagre 6 per cent for a further year beyond that.
Moreover, many of the more able pupils were leaking out of the system: even of the most able 10 per cent, two out of five had left before attaining their sixteenth birthday.
Crowther looked back to the previous and deeply influential report, also by the Central Advisory Council, on [hi]Early Leaving [/hi] (1954).
This showed that of 16,000 children entering grammar schools in 1946 (the year when I left one), more than half failed to secure even three passes at O level, and almost a third left even before the end of their fifth year.
As for the <head>children</head> of the unskilled workers, relatively few of them secured entry in the first place, and even those tended to do badly: only one in twenty survived to enter for two subjects at A level.

There it was revealed that the first born children of Aenarion still lived.
Sensing impending doom, their mother had sent them to be hidden in the Gaean vale.
Lost on their way, they had been rescued from a Chaos attack by the Treeman Oakheart and his people.
The Treeman had kept them safe in the deepest wildwoods while war raged.
Yvraine was ready to be crowned the new Everqueen.
In her the spirit of Astarielle would live on. [/p] [p]
The obvious choice for the next Phoenix King was Malekith, Aenarion's son by Morathi.

The other policeman was holding her down, while the doctor was cutting her down below.
As he cut she gave an almighty push and ripped open to her behind.
The child slipped into the world, still in its birth sac.
The doctor punched this open and looked at the little blue face inside.
He cleaned its nose and gently blow into its mouth while he pressed tenderly on its tiny ribcage.
The baby coughed and gave a little cry.
Then, taking a deep breath, began to bawl its head off.

A living will is a record of your wishes regarding medical treatment at the end of life.

Even if individuals do live in a nuclear family group it does not necessarily mean that their closest emotional ties are to be found there.
Many people when they have something to discuss may prefer to take it outside their family group to an old friend or a trusted adviser.
Christian people are often in this category, discussing issues that concern them within the trusted confines of their church fellowship or house group. [/p] [p]
When thinking about the bereaved, this is the sort of network of family and friends it becomes even more crucial to identify and contact.

Residential care has long been associated with care of deprived and delinquent children.
Within this tradition, however, there are many different histories of services found in the various European countries.
The historical antecedents in each case vary.
Fro example, in many countries residential services developed from religious organizations, in others charities have been important, whereas in England the Poor Law with its workhouse system established an elaborate care approach.
Similarly, residential care has been preferred at some times more than others, so until the eighteenth century in the Netherlands and Flanders [gap] [pb] the foster family was seen as the best place for orphans, foundlings, and abandoned <head>children</head> and has long been extensively used to care for needy children in Scotland (Packman, 1975; Pinchbeck and Hewitt, 1973; Pyck [hi]et al [/hi].,

Progress is often slow and the child should not feel forced or confronted to eat large quantities.
As soon as children start to feel upset about food their appetite disappears and the process of eating becomes much more difficult.
Rewards linked to clearing the plate can also help so that the child learns to accept the rule of eating what is on the plate.
Parents may need help and training in reacting positively when their child is eating.
Initially parents need to learn to smile and look or touch their child when food is being placed in the child's mouth and also for chewing and swallowing (McGuinn Koepke and Thyer 1985). [/p] [p]
Some children with a small appetite can be helped by having smaller meals more frequently.
Nutritious snacks will supplement [pb] the normal meals and avoid the <head>child</head> feeling overfull at any one point but then smaller quantities will be eaten at meal-times.

A further example of Herbert's tolerant disposition came when John found, as he grew up, that his sexual interests were exclusively homosexual.
When his mother found out about this (which was not until much later), it was a cause of great heartbreak to her.
But Herbert, for all his bourgeois, very respectable Victorian background and his own tendency to womanizing, made no attempt to dissuade his son.
Instead, he told him he must live his life his own way, and advised John, when he spoke of having fallen in love with a &bquo;straight&equo; boy at school, to try to save his love for someone who could return it.
Herbert may have been the less surprised since Robin says that one of Belle's brothers was homosexual, and so was one of Herbert's brothers although, in his case, married and the father of three <head>children</head> .

As a consequence the research review identifies as a central issue for investigation: &bquo;the variety of human interactions in which children are harmed in some way (physical, emotional, sexual), the manner in which these investigations are perceived, and the behaviour which such interactions elicit in both professional and lay people&equo; (Graham [hi]et al [/hi].,
1985, p.1218). [/p] [caption]

Only a lightly sketched attempt is made here to place the &bquo;kinship [pb] defenders&equo; and the &bquo;society-as-parent protagonists&equo; in the context of broader viewpoints and sets of values; a thorough analysis could be a very lengthy exercise.
It is suggested that a useful starting point might be to classify the nine major points of difference which are outlined as distinguishing the two value positions.
The following categories of difference seem to emerge.
Firstly, differences one and two, concerning questions of (1) the blood tie and the natural family and (2) the effects of uncertainty and multiple parent figures, seem to be essentially differences relating to conflicting ideas about [hi]<head>child</head> psychology [/hi]. [/p] [p]

For example at Edgehill, a GIST pack for discussion of sex roles &mdash; [hi]Gender in Our Lives [/hi] &mdash; was used in the personal and social education lessons, with teachers talking honestly and openly about their personal experience; as it happened they found themselves in the middle of a discussion about fathers being present at childbirth, and the <head>children</head> were obviously fascinated by this new view of their teachers as emotional beings. &lsqb;&hellip;&rsqb; [/p] [p]

Fiscal Structures and Policies [/head] [div3] [head]
The structure of revenues and expenditures [/head] [p]
Taxes are collected at three levels of government in Yugoslavia: by the federal government, by the governments of the republics and provinces, and by the communes, including some multi-commune cities.
(Some small levies by &bquo;local communities&equo; can conveniently be included with miscellaneous sources of revenue.)
The other main source of public revenue is &bquo;contributions&equo;, collected by &bquo;self-management communities of interest&equo;.
These &bquo;communities&equo; are of two kinds.
The first group, and by far the most important, consists of agencies for financing and managing the social services: education, health, pensions, <head>child</head> benefits, and some other minor services.

The more couples are able to tolerate differences in their partnership &mdash; between men and women, and between babies and parents &mdash; the less will the satisfactions of being a parent and being a married partner be eroded by children.
Past experiences affect how comfortable people are with differences and disparities in their marriage.
Having to be more separate can, for some people, resurrect memories of earlier separations which were particularly painful for them.
Illness, displacement by a younger brother or sister, or the divorce of parents are experiences from the past which can be interwoven with a current separation, overdetermining the strength of feelings and reactions in the present day.
Quite unconsciously, <head>children</head> may be regarded as rivals for a partner's attention, or, when they cry inconsolably, critics of a mother's competence.

However, some children who will eventually pass out of care through custodianship or adoption will spend periods, sometimes periods of years, in care after moving to permanent new families.
Social work practice with these families should concentrate on constructing a framework of security from the matching stage onwards, and this must mean delegating the maximum degree of responsibility to the new family to do things their way which the law allows. [/p] [p]
It also means that it is extremely important to get the matching stage right because no amount of back-seat driving will persuade new parents to change their basic way of running their family.
For example, if continued family contact is in the <head>child</head> 's best interest, social workers should make sure at the matching stage that the proposed new parents really believe so too.

As an example of the pitfalls involved in drafting questions, we can consider the fuss that there was in 1983 when Hill announced that he had found that as many as 40 per cent of six-year-old children had seen &bquo;video-nasties&equo; (i.e. video films of horror, violence, and sadistic sex).
In his questionnaire, he named some of the more famous such videos, and asked the children to say whether they had seen them.
His findings produced a lively press response, and questions in the House of Commons, and certainly contributed to the passage of a bill through Parliament to limit the availability of such films.

When the same scene happens night after night, his mother realizes that she has been doing the wrong thing, so instead she puts him to bed no matter how long or hard he cries.
But the message that bad behaviour no longer brings rewards will take a long time to get through because of its history of being occasionally (i.e. intermittently) reinforced.
His mother can speed up the process by putting a star chart on the wall (I discuss these incentives on page 57).
At our child and family centre just [pb] such a case and strategy led to a &bquo;success story&equo;.

The secondary resources are the tools the teacher brings to the learning environment in terms of equipment, ideas and materials.
These tools should enable all children, not only to gain access to the curriculum but also to allow and encourage them to respond to it in a way which clearly expresses their understanding.
The demand for these tools was recently illustrated in Ann FitzGerald's article (TES 1988) where she records Betsy Langford's poignant words: [quote] [p]
&hellip; children are used to feeling dissatisfied with their work, to expect chiding from the teacher and often mockery from their friends and to find that even when they've tried their hardest, the results don't reflect the amount of effort expended. [/p] [/quote] [/p] [p]

The move away from residential to alternative family care shaped the form of subsequent endeavours to help children.
Social work intervention concentrated on [hi]planning [/hi] for children in care, and [hi]resource finding [/hi] focusing on families and not institutions.
In practice the solution was to find the right placement for the children, rather than try to help the parents, child or care staff to adjust to each other.
Casework with parents, therapeutic work with children in care, and skills training for residential workers and field workers were now of secondary importance. [/p] [p]

The acceptance of a contract which sets out detailed conditions of service, hours worked and parents met is unlikely to provide the flexibility that is required for schools to respond quickly, humanely and sympathetically to family needs.
In my opinion it is this flexibility which has given English primary education its unique quality.
In the countries in which I have worked where tight regulations prescribe the teachers' day, the opportunity for intelligent freedom of action is all too often curtailed and responses to the problems which children present are all too often determined by the paragraph and footnote of a rule book. [/p] [p]
Children and their parents are human.
Being human the problems they present are unique, the ways of responding to them in finite.
The particular quality of the English primary school has been the way in which its teachers have been able to respond to the individual <head>child</head> on a personal, almost intuitive, basis.

But some children, either through their experience of using tantrums to get their own way or through general strong will and temperament, will take a lot of teaching and repeated experiences to realize finally that they cannot always get their own way.
Some children [pb] may be forced three or four times into a car safety seat to learn the rule but others may take twenty or thirty confrontations over the course of several weeks before they give in. [/p] [p]
Parents should try to list a series of daily confrontations that evoke tantrums.
They need to describe initially what issues they want to stand firm on and what issues they can give way to.
It is helpful for them to recognize that if they intend to carry through what they say, they may need to reduce the number of demands that they make on the child.

International Paint's well-established Jet-Dry Japlac now also comes in a handy aerosol to complement the existing range of standard cans, available in 750ml, 500ml, 250ml, and 125ml sizes, and to facilitate application in awkward areas, or where speed and convenience are prime considerations.
Japlac is a high gloss lacquer which produces a mirror-like finish that leaves ordinary paints looking lacklustre in comparison.
Its hard, shiny finish means it not only looks smart, but withstands knocks, bumps and scrapes.
It is easy to apply and can be used on wood or metal, inside or out, and its quick-drying formulation means it is touch-dry in two hours and ready for over-coating in six.
Japlac complies with BS 5665 Part 3 1989 and the European Toy Safety Standard EN71 Part 3 1988, enabling you to give an exceptionally glossy finish to toys, nursery furniture, climbing frames, and indeed any surface where the safety of a <head>child</head> is of tantamount importance.

Moral rules are foundational in the sense that they are concerned with the maintenance of, for instance, trust, mutual help and justice in human relationships.
Unless these exist in some measure it becomes virtually impossible to continue any social activity.
Moral rules form the yardstick against which we evaluate the rules of any particular activity.
It is therefore not surprising that, though conventions and customs vary widely from one society to another, basic moral principles apparently do not. [/p] [/quote] [/p] [p]

If you read old childcare manuals you soon become aware of a &bquo;pendulum&equo; of fashion swinging one way, then another.
Confusingly, parents were advised to do X; then, after perhaps a generation X was out, it was best to do Y. Nowadays we can rely on research studies for at least some evidence about the desirability and effectiveness of this or that approach, and about the influence of certain styles of parenting on the child's development and wellbeing.
In the end, however, childrearing is very much about values &mdash; and these are very individual matters, relating to one's attitudes, beliefs and style of living. [pb] [/p] [p]

The implication seems quite clear &mdash; the models of good practice developed in more general child care are equally applicable to child abuse and child protection work. [/p] [p]
If, as I have tried to demonstrate, the problem of child abuse is itself one dimension or label given to the way problems between children and adults manifest themselves then this should be recognized in practice.
Rather than seeing child abuse as an exceptional problem requiring an exceptional response, and hence a qualitatively different practice, we should see it as part of child care and hence child care practice. [/p] [p]
At many points in this chapter we have noted the problems of trying to define <head>child</head> abuse, identifying the characteristics which separate the high risk from the rest and hence aid prediction, together with the problems of constructing preventive and treatment interventions which concentrate exclusively on child abuse.

He could have continued placidly with the life he had chosen, and would have excelled; but telegrams of a peremptory nature, saying his mother's illness had taken a turn for the worse and he must come, kept arriving from Colonel Carteret, and Paul had to leave his work, abandon lectures, and make the weary journey to London time and again, only to find Sophia weak but resigned, and reproachful for his having come at all.
He was angry with the Colonel, who seemed to have taken a great deal upon himself.

The films highlighted three phases of separation reactions.
[pb] First of all, children were likely to protest about their parents' departure.
They would show signs of acute distress, crying loudly and vigorously.
This attempt to call their parents back could last for hours, days, even for a week or more.
When this protest failed, despair would follow.
The children remained preoccupied by their loss and would continue to cry from time to time, but in an increasingly hopeless and dejected way.
They would tend to withdraw from their surroundings, showing little interest in those around them and making few demands upon them.
Finally came a state of detachment which could misleadingly be regarded as recovery.

one defective copy of a suppressor gene, or in whom one copy is damaged

Another major factor in this positive trend was Ronald Reagan's decision
early in his presidency to fight the budget war on the expenditure side
rather than raising taxes.  George Bush's continued support of the tax dam
sustains this strategy of pressuring Congress to make choices among
competing priorities, rather than just saying yes to all the grateful

Ducks are this season's word for new taxes, under OMB Director Richard
Darman's formulation that ``if it looks like a duck, walks like a duck and
quacks like a duck, it's a duck.'' George Bush is quite clear: No new ducks.
But what about all those non-duck ducks flapping over Washington?  We see a
whole flock of programs that will impose significant costs on the American
economy in the form of burdensome regulation and higher liabilities.
Federal child care (quack).  The Clean Air bill (quack).  The
disabled-workers bill (quack, quack).  The Bush White House is breeding
non-duck ducks the same way the Nixon White House did: It hops on an issue
that is unopposable -- cleaner air, better treatment of the disabled,
better <head>child</head> care.

The calculations generally rely on an after-tax rate of return of 8 %
annually -- a rate historically obtainable by the individual in only one
place, the stock market.  Most of the mailers are free, but Denver-based
Financial Programs sells, for $15, a version customized to the age of the
child and the college of choice.  The figures are shocking.  To build a
nest egg that would pay for Stanford when a current first-grader reaches
college age, parents would need to set aside $773.94 a month -- for 12 years.
They can cut this to $691.09 a month if the investing keeps up through
college.  And they can further reduce the monthly amount if they start
saving earlier -- when mother and <head>child</head> come home from

In Pennsylvania, small businesses are pushing for a voluntary alternative;
they favor a commission that would develop sample leave policies that
employers could adopt.  They also support a tax credit for employers to
offset the cost of hiring and training workers who temporarily replace
employees on parental leave.  In 1990, the issue is expected to be
especially close in Alaska, California, Michigan, New York, Pennsylvania
and Illinois.  ``We 'll be playing a lot of defense, especially in the
Midwest and Northeast,'' says Jim Buente of the NFIB.  IN LOS ANGELES, more
small businesses ponder adopting a child-care policy.  Triggering the
re-examination is a recent city council decision to give preference in
letting city contracts to suppliers with a stated policy on
<head>child</head> care for their employees.

For years, we tried to ignore the problem of poverty, and now that it has
gotten out of hand it's a new crusade for the media and our Democratic
Congress.  Nobody should have to live in such poor conditions as in ``Sugar
Ditch,'' but when you travel to Washington, Boston, Chicago or New York,
the same problems exist.  The only difference is, in those cities the poor
are housed in high-rise-project apartments each consisting of one room,
with rusty pipes called plumbing, rodents and cockroaches everywhere and
nonworking elevators -- and with the building patrolled by gangs and drug
dealers.  Many middle-class people would love free food, Medicaid insurance,
utilities and rent.  Then maybe I could stay home and have seven children

Little Lily, as Ms. Cunningham calls herself in the book, really was n't

Coleridge had little sympathy with their overheated prose, and his own response to this charged and mysterious place probably had more in common with that of a later visitor, Samuel Palmer, who in the nineteenth century saw Culbone through visionary eyes.  [ptr]
Coleridge said in later life that the farmhouse to which he now retreated was called Brimstone (no doubt a Coleridgean attempt at Broomstreet, which stood two miles west of the combe).
His more contemporary recollection, however, [pb] placed the farmhouse &bquo;a quarter of a mile from Culbone Church&equo;, a description which has almost always been said to identify Ash Farm, but which is perhaps more likely to refer to the former Withycombe Farm.

The temptation to believe that what is most modern is also best &mdash; to see human history as a steady progress in knowledge and truth, probably culminating about wherever one happens oneself to be located &mdash; has always been almost irresistible, and popularised &mdash; if crude &mdash; evolutionary theory has, since the last century, added to what seems an historically continual tendency.
Its frequency however does not make it right.
Believing that people were always like we are, they just didn't understand themselves as well as we do, leads to dangerous historical inaccuracies.

In 1853 the English Congregational Chapel-building Society was founded to help local chapels and two years later the Rev. J. C. Gallaway published for the Society a tract on [hi]Practical Hints on the Erection of Places of Public Worship [/hi].
Congregationalists must convince their fellow Englishmen that they were &bquo;fully up to the spirit of the age&equo;.
&bquo;We are aiming not at the elaboration of a few but at the erection of many temples or houses of our Lord&equo; and therefore &bquo;cheapness in the construction of each is indispensable to success&equo; and Gothic chapels need not be expensive.
Their great value was that Gothic structures &bquo;are seldom mistaken for Mechanics' Institutes, Post Offices or Banks'.
Congregationalists should welcome the erection of towers and spires not, he insisted, &bquo;for the sake of display still less as affecting mere imitation of a wealthier body &lsqb; [hi]i.e. [/hi] the <head>Church</head> of England&rsqb; but for purely practical purposes.&equo;

The organization [pb] claimed membership from all parts of the South, and its membership contained education specialists, lawyers, people from the media, and civil servants, at least one of whom knew something of the existing channels of power and communication between church and state in the national school system.
Energy was directed mainly to the primary sector, where, until recently, it was impossible to have anything but a church-sponsored school if it was to be funded by the state.
In 1978, on the basis of their professional knowledge of schooling and civil administration, the organization succeeded in obtaining the necessary government permission to open in Dalkey a multi-denominational school governed principally by the parents, the mode of religious instruction to be determined by them.
It opened the following September.
Another project at Marley Grange in South Dublin was less successful, due in part to the <head>Church</head> of Ireland deciding to support its own primary school in the area, and in part to the open opposition of the local Roman catholic clergy. [/p] [p]

Such an exercise is, therefore, best done not in isolation but in co-operation with the other churches.
This reduces the workload and helps in the production of a more comprehensive and accurate picture.
Having worked together in the area of analysis, it is then more likely that you will be able to co-operate in developing a corporate strategy.
In such an exercise we should be especially alert to identify the unreached, contact new arrivals and respond to unmet needs. [/p] [p]
Such a community profile must have an eye to the future.

To a large degree this was centred, although not confined, to the newer, suburban churches, but it affected all aspects of Nonconformist church-life.
(Once again Nonconformity was in step with the Church of England which likewise saw tremendous improvements in the quality of her religious services.)
In Islington's famous Union Chapel, for example, the doors which opened into the auditorium had fixed to the wall beside them small boxes with a slit on the top; these were for worshippers' donations.
Someone had been thoughtful enough to provide a felt lining to the bottom of the box so that there would be no noise from the falling coins.
Union Chapel was also the home from 1852 to 1892 of Henry Allon.
The Congregational historian, Albert Peel, wrote that &bquo;it is probably true to say that no one did more to raise the standard of worship in Nonconformist <head>churches</head> &equo; than he.

Wagner states that &bquo;cultural integrity is part and parcel of human identity, and any system of thought or behaviour that denies cultural integrity is dehumanising&equo; (Wagner 1979c:97).
He is strongly opposed to an extractionist approach in evangelism.
&bquo;When a gospel is presented that explicitly or implicitly teaches that becoming a citizen of the Kingdom of God requires a denial of peoplehood, its authenticity must be called into question&equo; (Wagner 1978).

While Pius XII's encyclical [hi]Mystici Corporis [/hi] brought back the concept of the Church as the body of Christ to the centre of Catholic teaching, it most remarkably avoided the slightest reference in this to the relationship between the Eucharistic body and the ecclesial body, and omitted the slightest notice of the basic Pauline text for that relationship, 1 Corinthians 10.17.
The Council, on the contrary, when speaking about the Church as body of Christ, insisted that it is the Eucharistic body which forms the ecclesial body and twice quoted 1 Corinthians 10.17.
Again the Council stressed that the Church itself in consequence of all this has a sacramental character: it too is the &bquo;sacrament of salvation&equo;.
Further, the word &bquo;communion&equo;, a term again involving a verbal identification of <head>Church</head> and Eucharist, was so much used by the Council that it has subsequently been seen to express the Council's ecclesiology most profoundly and has been made great use of in such documents as those of ARCIC.

John Wesley said: &bquo;Give me a hundred preachers who fear nothing but sin, and desire nothing but God, and I care not a straw whether they be clergymen or laymen.
Such alone will shake the gates of hell and set up the Kingdom of God on earth.&equo;
We are in a decade when the timeless truth of John Wesley's words is apparent, and nowhere more so than in the realm of church planting.
The character of the leaders of the new churches is of great significance.
They do need to fear nothing but sin and desire nothing but God.
Stuart Christine, who teaches the new church planters' programme at Spurgeon's College, concluded after his initial research that the single most important factor in the planting of a new church is the calibre of the leader. [/p] [p]

The parish extended to Ellerby, Skirlaugh, Bilton, Burton Constable, Coniston, Thirtleby and Benninghome.
It was built in the 12th century (1150).
The church in those days was cruciform with a magnificent tower (now pulled down) in the centre.
The present church is the chancel of the original church with Norman-style pillars.
In 1154 a Cistercian nunnery existed in Swine; this was destroyed by Henry VIII when he gave orders to dissolve all monasteries.
The first listed vicar was Rev John Haitfield, dated 6th July 1323.
In more recent times Rev William Cobby was the vicar from August 1875 and died here in 1930 aged 83 years, after ministering to the parish for 55 years. [/p] [p]

It was a lament which registered the weakening of a moderate, socially philanthropic evangelicalism in the face of the more strident and ultimately more bigoted brand associated with Irving and Drummond outside the church and the Recordites within it.
This awareness contributed to the sense evangelicals in the Clapham tradition had of disorder within the church whose position itself appeared threatened by economic, social and political change.
The obvious questions for churchmen were how best to improve order within the church and how to impress the church upon society.
Whether their inclination was to enhance the symbiotic relationship of <head>church</head> and state or, for those of them tending towards support of Tractarianism, to reunify the church by distancing it from the state while reinforcing respect for its ordinance, hierarchy and &bquo;Catholic&equo; traditions, nonconformists were likely to perceive either process as antithetical to their status, rights and interests.

The new religion had to be seen to meet existing needs, and not to overtax the courage its converts would need to break with the religion of their ancestors.
But, once converted, they needed to define their new identity: they had to create discontinuities which would draw a line between their Christian present and their pagan past.
The realignment of these societies was necessarily slow, their central value-systems resistant to change.
Gregory of Tours and Bede both knew that the conversion of their peoples to Christianity had done something to the religion to which they were converted.
This is what made them anxious about the attitudes of powerful men in their societies &mdash; rulers, great magnates &mdash; towards the churches of which they considered themselves the lords.
They perceived that the acquisition of wealth and privilege exposed <head>churches</head> and monasteries to new dangers.

Before this YWAM had seen themselves solely as a youth evangelistic organisation that was an outreach arm of existing churches. [/p] [p]
In 1990 Floyd McClung published a paper outlining &bquo;Ten reasons why Youth With A Mission plants churches&equo;.
The reasons given are as follows.
First, it is the biblical pattern.
Second, planting churches lays a foundation for discipling whole nations.
Third, church planting is how unreached cities, nations and peoples will be reached with the gospel.
Fourth, church planting reaches all levels of society because the gospel is spread through family and relationship networks.
Fifth, churches are planted because this preserves [pb] the fruit of YWAM's evangelism.
Sixth, YWAM plants <head>churches</head> because they are a vital place of nurture for multi-generational groups of believers.

According to this interpretation, the protection of the &bquo;F&uuml;hrer myth&equo; &mdash; of the legend that Hitler was kept in the dark about the misdeeds of the regime, and acted promptly on learning of them &mdash; was a crucial component in bringing the &bquo;euthanasia action&equo; to an end.

Quite independent of the social merits of re-using a redundant building to provide comfortable dwellings for local people at modest rents, a main factor encouraging the retention of All Saints Church was the value accorded by the local authority planners to the building for its contribution to the townscape.
In this respect the Planning Department preferred the &bquo;permanent&equo; use offered by conversion to rented housing to a transitory use, such as might result from re-use of the building as, say, a carpet sales warehouse.

There was also the general assumption that the fact of a state populated by catholics must perforce imply a heightened degree of institutionalized catholic [pb] value in law.
On the other hand, there was the nationalist theory of democracy, which derives power from the people and not from an &eacute;lite group of religious intellectuals.
The next section will show the way in which this contradiction continued to be shared by a large number of clergy and laity even into the 1980s.
It should be added here that the high clergy hardly recognized that they had actually been exercising a political religious power of a specifically sectarian or monopolistic type.
Hence when Irish clergymen stated that <head>church</head> and state were separate, they meant they themselves had no legislative or executive role in the state.

Unfortunately, at the end of the sixteenth-century the whole fa&ccedil;ade was remodelled, as was the inside, and the local population was outraged.
The campanile was saved but it soon became ruinous.
A fund was set up for its restoration, but before the work could even be started the campanile collapsed.
The locals believed that the collapse was in protest at the new building work, but that hardly seems fair.
There were two victims of the collapse, a beggar and an old priest.
When the priest was searched it was found that he was carrying his will, and that he had left money for the restoration fund.
The present campanile is one of the better features of the building. [/p] [p]

When Charles II returned to England as king in 1660, the old compulsory state church was quickly restored and the freedoms of the 1650s soon vanished.
Having gone down with the monarchy in the 1640s and learnt from that experience that its fortunes were closely dependent on those of the crown, the established church was more than ever determined to shore up the monarchy as a means of guaranteeing its own survival.
Dr Robert South emphasized this point when he declared shortly after the Restoration that the Anglican church &bquo;glories in nothing more than that she is the truest friend to kings and to kingly government of any Church in the world&equo;.
It is also clear that there was a great deal of support for the old <head>church</head> throughout the country, and particularly from the gentry elites of provincial England.

The creation of several dwellings within a building previously devoted to one use necessitates the division of the original large single volume of the church interior and the loss of the special qualities of light, spaciousness and acoustics which that large volume possesses.
Compartmentation of the interior means that the building is experienced in a new way &mdash; details which were once distant (and which may have been executed in the knowledge that they would not be viewed at close hand) are seen in &bquo;close-up&equo; for the first time and in relation to much smaller and more intimate spaces (Plate 20).

These critics did not perhaps all observe the extent to which Barth was opening up a new path, for no one before had handled the doctrine of the Trinity in this fashion.
We shall notice in a little how he was to build further upon the foundations laid in 1927, and what a distinctive theology resulted. [/p] [p]
At any rate, Barth himself was to come to make exactly the opposite criticism of the book, which he later used to call &bquo;my well&rehy;known false start&equo;.
He subsequently concluded that, in spite of his own intentions, it was still too deeply coloured by the thought of Kierkegaard and Heidegger, that it gave faith a wrong kind of priority over revelation in the arrangement of its material, and that its account of faith was more Existentialist than Christian.
Five years later he took up the project again under the new title of [hi]<head>Church</head> Dogmatics [/hi].

The assault on the remaining Wealden woodland was probably halted.
New land-working agreements frequently had to be negotiated, and enclosure into small fields for peasant cultivation may have replaced open land and the strip system of some villages on the coastal plain.
There particularly, a number of communities which had only been partially viable now began to disintegrate.
In Sussex there are known to be some 43 sites of deserted medieval villages.
Not all can be traced to the Black Death, but it must have been a significant factor.
In the high downland north-west of Chichester, the four neighbouring villages of Up Marden, North Marden, East Marden and West Marden effectively lost the first two communities, whose small thirteenth-century churches now stand magnificently isolated.

There were times when the ministry of her Son left her feeling cut out of the action, and she was amazed and perhaps frightened at what she had unleashed on the world.
The questions led up to the cross and even beyond it.
On that cross her dying Son said to John: &bquo;Behold, your mother!&equo;
(John 19.27) There she lost everything that really mattered.
Surely there could not have been a more destructive fire than Calvary; but more was to come.
Through the resurrection the fire scorched forth at pentecost and to the foundation of the Church.
The fire, burning its way through the structures of old Israel, created a new community of faith and love. [/p] [p]

The readings and psalms in the vernacular (often helped by clearer new versions, on which see below) and the call for more biblical sermons have already brought appreciable changes in Catholic worship and attitudes.
But there are continuing blockages and problems, many of them practical.
In many large churches, built to enable the greatest possible numbers to attend Sunday Mass, the circumstances of worship too often hinder an effective liturgy of the Word.
In contrast, in smaller and more informal gatherings such as house Masses, the power this can release has often been experienced so impressively that one wonders whether the new liturgy was not given to the <head>Church</head> prophetically, with a view to new [pb] circumstances which were to come, but which till now have been realized only unevenly.

I long for the day when those in authority will be united in a common quest to win the lost without worrying about the style of Anglican worship; when they will see that a prime means to evangelise our nation will be to plant churches and encourage it without worrying about parochial boundaries.
My recommendation is that we scrap them for the ten year decade of evangelism as a trial period and then think again in AD 2000! [/p] [p]
Another tragic effect of this emphasis on &bquo;Anglican ethos&equo; and the maintaining of the status quo by parish boundaries is the disincentive to leaders to stay and build a work whose multiplication is limitless.
When a curate has planted one new church, he is encouraged strongly to uproot, move and start all over again in a completely new situation.
If you wanted to devise a scheme to slow down growth, you could not do better.
What would be more helpful would be the [pb] encouragement to take a team from your current <head>church</head> to a nearby and needy area so plant from strength, and multiply organically and naturally.

The fact that Leonard was influenced so deeply by [hi]Divan del Tamarir [/hi] is very suggestive, for it is one of the types of poems known as [hi]gacela [/hi] (the other is [hi]casida [/hi]), a short-rhymed fixed verse-form in Arabic poetry.
It naturally shares much with its literary cousin, Hebrew poetry, on which Leonard had been raised from his earliest days.
Another aspect, quite apart from this shared verse-form and linguistic usage, is the natural hyperbole endemic to it, which is but a step away from the &bquo;surrealist&equo; usage of language that Lorca essayed.
Further, his Catholicism also deeply influenced, if subconsciously, Leonard's own awareness of it in [pb] Catholic Montreal.

In his writings Sant' Ambrogio occasionally made reference to the Basilica Vetus, a very early (perhaps the earliest) Christian church in Milan.
Some scholars have claimed that the fact that Ambrose did not give an exact site for the church &mdash; indeed, it seems he was actually careful [hi]not [/hi] to &mdash; means that it was not a real church at all, merely a metaphor.
Nevertheless, archaeologists and historians have looked for Vetus for years.

Only de Valera's personal intervention convinced them of their lack of perception and judgement.

When the congregation of the Lutheran Church gathered to hear the Word of God expounded, they expected to hear it expounded fully, and the Pastor of Tappersdorf was ready to oblige, not merely comparing the German text for the day &mdash; a reference to the doings of an obscure Old Testament prophet &mdash; with the original Hebrew, and giving a learned half-hour to an explanation of the circumstances in which the prophet lived, suffered, and prophesied, a time in which it seemed a small group of people struggled for the truth and searched for God under the shadow of huge decadent empires to the East &mdash; and the West, but he, the Pastor, was perfectly willing to apply the prophet's message to the present day &mdash; and to present-day socialist Germany, at that.

Once he had come to the throne, Charles quickly answered this call for religious change by promoting notable Arminians to positions of prominence in both church and state.
Disquiet at the new direction of religious affairs soon surfaced in parliament, and over the next few years a growing number of MPs began to speak out against the Arminian threat.
In 1629, the intense anxiety and frustration of the MPs erupted into violence, as the Speaker of the Commons was held down in his chair while the House forced through motions condemning the religious innovations. [pb] [/p] [p]
This incident finally convinced Charles that he should abandon his efforts to work with parliament, and he embarked on a period of personal rule, which lasted until 1640.

Kraft, in Part IV of his book [hi]Christianity in Culture [/hi] entitled &bquo;The Dynamics of Revelation&equo; introduces a new perspective to the debate on the inspiration of Scripture among evangelicals.
He sees the Bible as containing a section of classic case [pb] studies of the ways God deals with humankind in a variety of situations across a considerable period of time.
As such, it emphasises that God's revelatory activity is a dynamic process rather than a static product.
The completion of the canon of Scripture by the early Church does not signify that they thought the Lord had stopped speaking or that he had nothing fresh to say.
The purpose of Scripture is to act as a &bquo;yardstick&equo; and &bquo;tether&equo; by which to assess any claim to contemporary revelation, and to regulate its interpretation.
The Holy Spirit continues to operate in revealing the mind of Christ to his <head>Church</head> .

Go left to reach the small square of Piazza Sant' Eufemia, where across a small lawn that is longer than it is wide and bordered by tall conifers, you will see the church that gives the piazza its name.
The church is in Romanesque style, but in this case it is mock-Romanesque, completion being many years after the style had ceased to be used.
Although the chalk and brickwork is striking, the over-elaborate design is indicative of a later period of construction.
Internally, Sant' Eufemia is pleasant rather than exciting, although the large altar piece, by Marco d'Oggiono, a follower of Leonardo and one of the supporters of his monument in the Piazza della Scala, is excellent. [/p] [p]

The aliens and absentees who pushed their claims too far fanned the flames of popular revolt in Sussex in the later fourteenth and fifteenth centuries and bore the brunt of the explosions that followed.
For most people the church provided the main consolations in a short and hard life: devotions, ritual and, occasionally, the feasts of Scot ales, where the parson paid for the drink, and on great occasions, such as the Feast of St Pancras in Lewes, festivities and public ceremony.
To some it gave help in sickness and consolation in poverty.
But it was as much a legal body as a spiritual one, although occasionally this could work for the individual's unexpected benefit as in the laws relating to sanctuary or &bquo;abjuring the realm&equo;.

Fig. 8 Alexander James Beresford Beresford Hope, MP, Chairman of the Select Committee on the Foreign Office Reconstruction 1858. [/caption] [p]
Alexander James Beresford Beresford Hope (1820&ndash;87) was a member of a family of connoisseurs, collectors and patrons, whose wealth derived from the family banking business in Amsterdam.
His father Thomas Hope, who settled in England about 1796, became through his writings and patronage the central figure in the neo-classical movement in England, and made his Duchess Street house, and Deepdene near Dorking, centres for his extensive collections.
Alexander, his third son, was educated at Harrow and Cambridge where he met, as well as Manners, Benjamin Webb who introduced him to the Cambridge Camden Society.
This Society, which later changed its name to the Ecclesiological Society, sought to make <head>churches</head> more worthy settings for worship and for the liturgy of the Church of England.

There is a tendency for church planting groups to assume [pb] they know best what is liturgically best for that area and, sometimes, out of the window goes any recognizable Anglican liturgy with the incumbent who, unrobed and in open-necked shirt, introduces the choruses in front of the now universal overhead projector&hellip;
I am saying we must not supplant Anglican worship for a free-wheeling non-conformist style which owes more to Spring Harvest [corr] than [/corr] the A.S.B. [/p] [/quote] [/p] [p]
Some may want to ask immediately: &bquo;Why on earth not?&equo;
And those who have been to Spring Harvest may respond: &bquo;To avoid the notices!&equo;
Seriously, one can understand the Archbishop's concern to retain the best of the tradition: a liturgy involving elements of worship; confession; intercession; Bible reading; biblical preaching and blessing.
Personally, I respect his view and at the same time am glad of his enthusiasm for <head>church</head> planting: &bquo;I am convinced that Church Planting is a mark of vigorous and outgoing Christianity and is a sign of hope for the future&equo;, he says. [/p] [p]

One Anglican minister then working in a church on a housing estate in the Coventry area concluded that his methods of dealing with families bringing their babies for baptism and couples coming to make wedding arrangements needed radical reappraisal.
His sincere and careful counselling was ineffective in introducing them to the life of the church.
After the &bquo;great event&equo; they were not seen again in the church until the next &bquo;rite of passage&equo; came along.
He decided on an entirely new approach.
Instead of seeing them individually in the privacy of his study, he arranged regular &bquo;Sharing Jesus&equo; evenings to which the baptism families and wedding couples were invited.
There they met an equal number of members of the congregation, people like themselves, who would be invited to share their experiences.
This new policy has paid dividends.

Whenever the liturgy of the Word remains formal and lifeless, it shows that these fundamental sacramental and liturgical principles have yet to be learnt (see Bianchi, 1987, pp. 120&ndash;2). [/p] [p]
While training for preaching has happily improved since the Council, other factors have sadly hampered and slowed down the work of theological re-education.
A tragic number of those best equipped to explain the Council's teaching retired from the clergy in the later 1960s and the 1970s, and thereafter were disqualified from teaching as a ministry in the Church, though there is no moral justification for a general judgement that such persons become unworthy to teach.
The right to preach within the Mass is jealously reserved to the clergy, whereas members of the laity often prove to be endowed with this charism.

The church planting team will feel the touch of the potter moulding the clay into a new and unique vessel.
In church growth terms it will be at this point that the leaders will be gaining the &bquo;vision&equo; for the work.
This has almost become a technical term meaning philosophy of ministry or an understanding of, crudely, what they are there for.
As the community church was formed, the vision was for &bquo;intimacy&equo;.
It was not in this case a call to work in a particular area of the community, but rather it was a call to intimacy.
Intimacy with God, with each other, and with the neighbourhood in which we lived, following the example of Jesus in John 1:14: &bquo;The Word became flesh and lived for a while among us.&equo; [/p] [p]

This is legitimate if we are tracing the evolution of contemporary attitudes to religion, or studying the history of ideas; but if we wish to regain an impression of eighteenth century people as a whole we need to recall that, even among educated men (themselves a very small minority), intellects cast in the mould of David Hume and Tom Paine were exceedingly rare, however great their later influence may have been.
Amongst the great majority, the faith of earlier centuries persisted, at least outwardly; indeed, if we look for a movement of thought and feeling that by the end of the century had penetrated into every class of society except the highest, we shall find it in the revival of &bquo;vital religion&equo;, or &bquo;enthusiasm&equo;, as it was also called.

During Elizabeth's long reign a mere nineteen churches or chapels were built, and only a handful more, including Fulmer and Bletchley in Buckinghamshire, Groomsbridge and St Nicholas, Rochester, in Kent, and St John Briggate in Leeds, were completed under the early Stuarts.
Given the widespread destruction of church interiors during the post-Reformation period and the relentless removal of &bquo;superstitious&equo; objects, it is hardly surprising that the parishioners of the mid- and late sixteenth century were unwilling to finance new ecclesiastical building or furnishing.
Furthermore, the new Protestant theology did little to encourage donation, since solafidianism removed much of the potential advantage to benefactors, and the emphasis upon the Word reduced the importance of beautifying the church interior.
The laity, therefore, became reluctant to invest in their local <head>churches</head> , while an impoverished ecclesiastical establishment had few resources to spare for its buildings. [/p] [p]

Assuming for now that the cause of death is known and that there is no need for an inquest or autopsy then the death certificate is next taken to the Registrar for Births, Deaths and Marriages.
This is of course traumatic in itself and involves an interview with the Registrar which we will discuss in more detail in chapter 11.
At the end of this interview, amongst other things, the person registering the death will receive a piece of paper that authorizes the undertaker to be called to make arrangements.
It is quite often the case that the person making the arrangements has not had to do this job before and so relies heavily on what he remembers from other funerals he has attended and on the undertaker's advice.
In discussing arrangements he will be asked if he wants a clergyman to conduct the funeral service and most frequently the answer to this is yes.

The communism of the early Church is also an interesting contrast to Marxist egalitarianism.
The essential feature of the community of Jerusalem Christians was their total other&rehy;worldliness, i.e. the three-key decision (a) between work and leisure; (b) between consumption, saving and giving; and (c) between accumulating and selling assets was not to be influenced by personal consumption and gain.
In other words communism under freedom is possible only to the extent that people are motivated by non-economic rewards.
Marxism in practice however is not voluntary but forced, not spontaneous but planned.
Equality is possible only when people are systematically denied the freedom to choose. [/p] [p]

At a recent White House meeting, Rep. Silvio Conte (R., Mass.), the ranking
minority member of the House Appropriations Committee, argued with his
friend Mr. Bush against a veto, and though Mr. Conte and Minority Leader
Robert Michel of Illinois stood with the president yesterday, they are
plainly uncomfortable with his position.  ``This is n't a political issue,
this is a moral issue,'' said Rep. Henry Hyde (R., Ill.), the most eloquent
spokesman for the anti-abortion movement.  But after years of using the
issue for its benefit, the GOP finds its candidates on the defensive.  New
Jersey gubernatorial candidate Rep. James Florio pointedly returned from
campaigning to vote against the president yesterday in contrast with his
opponent, GOP Rep. James Courter, who has ardently supported abortion
restrictions in the past but was absent.  In an extraordinary mix of
cultures and church-state powers, Rep. Robert Dornan (R., Calif.) lectured
his fellow Roman Catholics -- including Mr. Florio -- for having the ``
chutzpah'' to disagree with the hierarchy of their
<head>church</head> on abortion.

South Korea and Japan continue to be profitable.  Moon's Tong'Il industry

Mr. Moon planned to convert millions of Americans to his unique brand of
Christianity -- in which he plays the role of Old Testament-style temporal,
political messiah -- and then to make the U.S. part of a unified
international theocracy.  His original strategy (in itself a brilliant
innovation for spreading a religion) was to create new economic enterprises
each time he wanted to extend and fund his various religious missions.
Tax-exempt airport and street-corner solicitations were intended only to
provide start-up funds.  More stable industries were to build an
economically viable infrastructure for the Moon movement in North America,
as they had in Japan and South Korea.  Then he would move his movement to
Europe.  But that was not to be.  Throughout the 1970s and early 1980s

No one speaks, and the snaking of the ropes seems to make as much sound as
the bells themselves, muffled by the ceiling.  Totally absorbed, the
ringers stare straight ahead, using peripheral vision (they call it ``

above in the belfry, the huge bronze bells, mounted on wheels, swing madly
through a full 360 degrees, starting and ending, surprisingly, in the
inverted, or mouth-up position.  Skilled ringers use their wrists to
advance or retard the next swing, so that one bell can swap places with
another in the following change.  In a well-known detective-story involving

Since joining the Politburo in 1983 as its youngest member, Mr. Krenz had
acquired the nickname ``crown prince,'' a reference to the widely held view
that he was the hand-picked successor to Mr. Honecker.  In fact, the two
men have had strikingly similar career paths, both having served as chief
of internal security before their rise to the top party position.  Moreover,
both men have hewn to a similar hard-line philosophy.  Notably, one of Mr.

China after the massacre in Beijing.  He later defended the Chinese

A c.c.d. delay line provides a delay because it takes a certain amount of time for each input sample to be passed along the chain of capacitors and to finally emerge at the output.
The delay time is governed by two factors, which are the number of stages in the circuit, and the speed at which the samples are passed from one stage to the next. [/p] [p]
In practice the rate at which samples are passed along the device is controlled by a clock oscillator.
On the face of it, the delay time in seconds is equal to the number of stages, divided by the clock frequency in Hertz.
In reality it is only half this figure.
This is due to the fact that the capacitors cannot simultaneously pass on their charge to the next stage and receive the charge from the previous stage. [/p] [p]
Each capacitor first receives a sample, and then passes it on.
This means that there are only half as many samples in the <head>circuit</head>as there are delaying stages. [/p] [/div2] [div2] [head]

Next the first capacitor is connected back to the input so that a fresh sample voltage is taken.
Meanwhile, the second capacitor passes its charge on to the third capacitor.
Then the first capacitor is coupled to the second one again, and so on. [/p] [p]
This process is repeated indefinitely, with a stream of input samples being taken and passed along the chain of capacitors.
Of course, eventually the samples reach the last capacitor in the chain, where they provide the output signal before being discarded. [/p] [p]
Delay lines which use this method are popularly known as &bquo;bucket brigade&equo; devices.
This term is derived from the fact that the way in which these <head>circuits</head>operate is roughly analogous to buckets of water being passed along a human chain (as in the old method of fire fighting).

Eurosport frequently puts out the BBC's own pictures simultaneously, and showed more of them live from the Ryder Cup last month than the Beeb itself.
It receives them automatically as a member of the European Broadcasting Union, a privilege granted to it because 15 member stations of that cosy cartel own the half of Eurosport which Murdoch does not. [/p] [p]

Despite this official denial, [hi]New Scientist [/hi] stands by its report that the Abbey Hill electronic support measures (ESM) equipment aboard the destroyer identified the missile that sank it as friendly (This Week, 10 February, p 353). [/p] [p]
After the sinking of HMS Sheffield, the Ministry of Defence asked MEL (which makes the Abbey Hill equipment) to come up with a modification to ensure that it rapidly alerted crews to further Exocet attacks.
Until the Sheffield incident, the MoD had abided by an agreement with Exocet's French manufacturers that the British would not open up the missile's guidance section.
After the attack on Sheffield, MoD technicians got out their screwdrivers. [/p] [p]

Even this only becomes valuable when you are below 1000 feet, by which time, of course, you will have moved closer to the gliding site or nearer to a suitable field if you are flying across country.
At this height, if you do not make efficient use of any lift you find, you will be down. [/p] [p]
Many pilots give up at 1000 feet when there is still a fair chance of finding something and getting away safely.
At low altitudes, it is necessary not only to use the height most effectively to search, but also to retreat gradually to your position, off to one side of the landing area for a good base leg and an easy landing. [/p] [p]
This is all valuable experience.
If you do run into lift, you must assess the situation on each turn, being ready to break off for a normal base leg and approach.
Of course, this is impractical on a site with a lot of power traffic or where a rigid <head>circuit</head>procedure is in force.

The result is that pin 10 goes low for a fixed period determined by the values of C1 and R2; approximately 0.1 seconds with the values given. [/p] [p]
Capacitor C2 charges via resistor R4 such that the voltage at pin 5 of gate IC1b gradually rises from 0V, taking about 60 seconds to reach a level recognised as a logic 1 by the CMOS NAND gate IC1b.
Every time the monostable output pulses low, transistor TR1 switches on and capacitor C2 loses a substantial amount of its charge via resistor R3 and down to 0V through the emitter of TR1.
Thus the monostable essentially resets the one-minute timer back to zero. [ptr][pb] [/p] [caption]

The line should be capable of at least a 60 amp supply and possibly up to 100 amp for a large property or heavy user. [/p] [p]
From the sealed fused container located inside the house, &bquo;tails&equo; are taken to the consumer control switch, past a main fuse to the consumer's distribution unit with 6, 8 or 10 connecting points and fuses.

A team at the Fraunhofer Institute for Applied Solid State Physics in Freiberg has reported a breakthrough in high speed frequency dividers. [/p] [p]
What the German group has done ( [hi]Electronics Letters [/hi], Vol 27 No 13) is to create a static master-slave flip-flop which operates at 14GHz but has a dissipation of less than 35mW.

They respond to changes in gate potential, not absolute levels &mdash; switching between 0 and 3V looks the same to an igfet as switching between &mdash; 3 and 0V.
Perhaps the easiest way of looking at this is to think of the surface states as a charge store, which effectively shifts the switching level of the device. [/p] [p]
In addition to its unusual electrical properties, the igfet is simple to make, and, because of the insulated gate structure, current into the gate is virtually eliminated.
All of this makes it very attractive for the application which Luck and Swanson have been working on &mdash; the construction of switched capacitor filter circuits. [/p] [p]
Switched capacitor circuits normally use silicon mosfets, of GaAs mesfets.
But the former will only switch at a relatively low speed (42MHz), and the latter produce complex, power-hungry <head>circuits</head> .

Transformers are readily available with 20V secondaries and of 80VA rating, both standard and toroidal.
Two separate secondaries are commonly provided and these can be paralleled to supply the total 3A current required, which is only 1.5A per winding.
On the prototype a 100VA transformer, which was unnecessarily big, but because it happened to be standing on the shelf, was used.
If you happen to have anything like this, by all means use it. [/p] [p]

The aircraft concerned was in the hangar with one engine removed.
A crane arrived and the propeller from a second engine was removed in preparation for a further engine change.
Immediately after the removal of the propeller, the nose of the aircraft started to rise and continued to do so, to everyone's amazement, until the tail was almost down to the ground.
A tail-steady, which should have been in place under a hard point before work started, was about 6&ins; out of position.
The result was a &bquo;crunch&equo; as the tail-steady plunged into the soft skin of the rear fuselage. [/p] [p]
A No 149 Squadron aircraft suffered substantial damage while in flight due to gun-shot.
The gun turrets had safety <head>circuits</head>which stowed the guns horizontally but not longitudinally.

In 1780 Portadown and Tandragee were part of the Charlemont Circuit and a service was held in Portadown every other Sunday.
In 1788 the Tandragee Circuit was formed in the house of James Lemon, a chandler.

The first Love Feast was held in Portadown in 1791 and was conducted by the Reverend Samuel Steele in the house of Thomas Bunting who had joined the Society the previous year. [/p] [p]

The engine mounts on the engine will need re-working to fit the 4-cylinder chassis.
There is no modification needed to the bulkhead. [/p] [p]
The second way is to retain your gearbox, which has a shorter primary shaft than the V8 and fit the engine using the SD1 V8 bell housing or a V8 to Series III type adaptor plate.
Both leave the engine some four inches further back in the chassis and need bulkhead modifications to the footwells to allow the back of the engine to clear.
This route also means making up a suitable exhaust system and long radiator hoses and leaves a large gap between radiator and engine. [/p] [p]
The first way is best but involves the extra expense of a gearbox.
You will ultimately have a better vehicle however.

These are programs written on read-only memory chips.
To copy them, the pirate has to feed the program into the computer's memory, then read it back onto a disc.
Atari makes it more difficult by writing into the operating system (the instructions that govern how the computer handles data) an instruction that does not allow the computer to talk to disc drive and cartridge at the same time. [/p] [p]
Enthusiasts [hi]can [/hi] overcome this by ramming the cartridge into its socket while the drive is running.
But this is unreliable, and can cause the machine to crash.

Unlike civil servants, who win their jobs by competitive examination, judges depend upon a process of consultation and soundings which reproduces the judiciary in its own image.
Twenty years ago, officials admit, it was an amateurish, informal process.
Now, aspiring judges are called to a room at the western end of the Palace of Westminster overlooking the Thames, and, seated on chairs stamped with the gilt portcullis, interviewed about their suitability for the job.
After this interview, their success or failure depends upon their winning the good opinion of existing judges whose views are canvassed informally by civil servants in the Lord Chancellor's office.
Once appointed, <head>circuit</head>judges can be sacked only for incapacity or misbehaviour (one lost his job in 1984 after involvement in a smuggling racket), while to get rid of High Court judges or their seniors demands a joint address of both Houses of Parliament to the Queen.

Try circling at low speed and reversing the turn to get the feel of the ailerons.
Then check it is clear below and attempt a straight stall, followed by a few stalls in very gentle turns.
This will tell you if the glider has an obvious stall buffet and if it is likely to drop a wing during a stall when thermalling. [/p] [p]
Before you go down into the circuit area, increase the speed to 60&ndash;70 knots and try the airbrakes to see how badly they snatch and how effective they are.
Also try side-slipping at the approach speed to see if the rudder overbalances badly or the side-slipping is unusual in any way.
This could be serious if you had to make a side-slip to get down into field on an early flight. [/p] [p]

Check the pinouts before wiring the 24-pin connector. [/p] [p]

On this bass the two single-coil J-type pickups are Bartolinis, which are often thought of as almost over-efficient, with a too-bright sound, but this characteristic (shared by the Pedullas reviewed recently) can be modified by the onboard circuitry. [/p] [p]
The controls are unusual.
Two independent volumes, and independent bass/mid/treble rotaries offer a massive &plusmn;21dB of boost or cut, thanks to the onboard Tamtec circuitry.
The toggle switch is two-position, and flicking it on takes the sound straight to a pre-determined setting.
As I mentioned earlier, this rather unusual configuration was as a result of customer specification.
In the control cavity, which, like that of the two-PP9 battery compartment, is covered by a smoked perspex plate, we find the wonderfully neat Tamtec double-sided, plated <head>circuit</head>board, neatly cut to fit the cavity perimeter.

If the glider is very low and there is not a clear area immediately ahead and below, a stalling type of crash will be inevitable.
Even if the pilot is fully aware of being close to the stall, he will instinctively hold off until the glider stalls down the last few feet rather than fly into obstructions at speed.
It is easy to realise that in gusty conditions, if the glider is being flown slowly, the stall may occur high enough for a wing to drop and for an incipient spin to develop with even more serious results. [/p] [p]
Obviously it is very important to train every pilot to recognise when his planning is leading to a disastrous situation, and to take action in time to avoid it.
Usually these situations arise from running out of height on the <head>circuit</head> , but they can also arise from arriving back far too high and by badly planned manoeuvring in an attempt to correct that kind of position. [/p] [p]

Braille and large print materials are bulky; braillers, typewriters, tape recorders and closed circuit television sets are both heavy and demanding of space.
The need to store and maintain specialised equipment in good condition is a problem that has to be faced by schools accepting pupils who need to use these in order to fulfil their special educational needs.
A central storage and resource room reduces pressure for space in individual teaching rooms, but needs pre-planning and co-operation in order to have equipment available for specific lessons.
In preparing particular sections or blocks of work for classes or groups of pupils which include visually handicapped children it can be useful to code in a mark when drafting the programme to indicate the need for a piece of specific equipment to be available, and check this quickly on a daily basis (for example, closed <head>circuit</head>television tape recorder; overhead projector).

The nominal transformation ratio n in the instance shown is 4:1 step down, but unlike some other voltage-changing schemes using capacitors, n can be any whole number; it is not limited to powers of 2.
This advantage apart, the circuit is of limited practical use as the efficiency is not too high due to all the diode drops.
But one day someone will invent the perfect rectifier, and then.

Stella Fearnley, once again, questions the point of the dinner circuit.
I am certain that 21 of the 22 district society presidents in 1991/92 found it to be very valuable.
There is no compulsion to go to every dinner and one is not expected to do so.
However, it is an ideal opportunity to meet one's colleagues on a regular basis and to discuss matters of concern.
It is also an ideal opportunity to meet with members of other district societies to learn how they approach matters.
A useful exchange of views always takes place and engenders an excellent team spirit, which proved its worth with the campaign for increased subscriptions when we all felt we were working towards the same goal and had a common purpose.
It is essential that presidents meet together on a regular basis and the dinner <head>circuit</head>provides the ideal forum for this.

After much hard work &mdash; Hunt castigates himself for driving the first third of the race like a &bquo;grandmother&equo; &mdash; Hunt eventually got by Jody when Scheckter was held up by a back-marker.
Next it was Hunt's turn to be confused by the Australian Warwick Brown, who was driving his first race and who, practically without gears, was going as near zero as possible in the middle of the chicane.
Snatching at his gears, Hunt missed, Jody caught up with him and blew past.
So once again, getting past Jody was essential.
Hunt knew he had the faster car; what he needed was the opportunity.

One of my bigger irritations is when I have an enormously tight schedule taking me all over the country and I get calls &mdash; sometimes on my mobile phone when I'm stuck in the middle of a field somewhere &mdash; insisting that it's vitally important I attend a meeting that has just been scheduled for three o'clock that afternoon in London, which could easily have been planned at least two weeks earlier.

When you're drawing up the timetable right at the beginning there is no reason why you cannot fix your planning meeting dates, and stick pretty closely to them.
There are rare occasions when emergency meetings are necessary but such crises are nearly always avoidable if people are working well and the schedule has been properly organised. [/p] [p]

Many areas of the brain are insensitive to the lesion making effects of the toxins currently available, so this approach has to be used quite selectively.
A final problem is that these substances may be taken up into the blood supply as it passes through the brain and carried to other parts of the body where they may have toxic effects that confound their effects on the nervous system. [/p] [/div4] [div4] [head]
Conceptual problems [/head] [p]
Despite these technical limitations, physiological psychologists take the lesion method very much for granted.
If one were to suggest to an electronics engineer that he might want to study how a circuit works by pulling bits out and observing changes in function his reaction would probably be one of horror!
His argument would be that most electronic <head>circuits</head>are organized interactively, by which we mean that the proper operation of one component depends on the normal operation of all of the others.

Typical of the ambivalence of the anti-Puritan ethic in Hefner's hands, they were supposed to be untouchable.
Their Bunny tails, as Norman Mailer put it, were &bquo;puffs of chastity which bobbled as they walked.&equo;

Either buy &bquo;presensitised&equo; copper-clad board, or apply the light-sensitive coating yourself. [/p] [p]
Pre-sensitised board is available in standard sizes just like plain copper-clad board, and the manufacturer treats the copper with a UV sensitive etch-resist ink and generally protects this with a peel-off paper sheet, see Fig 1.
It is more convenient to purchase pre-sensitised boards which are then cut to the required size, but [hi]DO NOT [/hi] remove the protective film until you are ready to expose the board to ultra-violet light. [/p] [p]
Alternatively you can try to apply the sensitive etch-resist ink yourself, and special positive-working aerosols are available for this purpose.

The germanium layer confines the charges just under the skin, preventing them from bumping into the surface and scattering from their designated path through the transistor. [/p] [p]
Researchers built the channel so that it is free of dopants, stopping the charges from bumping into impurity atoms along the way.
Instead, a layer of doped silicon is placed directly underneath the channel.
This dopant layer sets the voltage at which the transistor turns off and on. [/p] [p]
As a result, the mobility of the charges as they travel through the transistor is twice as good as any similar, submicron p-channel mosfet transistor yet built. [/p] [p]
A p-channel transistor, relying on hole mobility, is usually slower than an n-channel device.

Faris claims that unlike the Josephson junction, the quiteron is insensitive to stray magnetic fields, and returns to equilibrium automatically when the external excitation is turned off.
Another big plus is that its two separate states are very different &mdash; it is easy for other devices to detect which &bquo;state&equo; a quiteron switch is in.
The switching speed looks good too.
Faris is sure that it is lower than 300 picoseconds, although he does not have the equipment to prove his prediction that it is less than 50 picoseconds (10 [hi]-12 [/hi] seconds).
Transistors, however, have a lower limit of 20 picoseconds. [/p] [p]

Some ministers devoted part of their time to local affairs: S. J. Smith, for example, was born in Bedford in 1822 and became a Congregational minister in Enfield after attending a denominational college and taking the London BA.
&bquo;He was recognised by all classes as a Christian gentleman, courteous, affable, and sympathetic.&equo;
Although he &bquo;sought to avoid public controversy&equo; &mdash; a standard Victorian prefix to anyone who enthusiastically engaged in political warfare &mdash; he was elected as a Poor Law Guardian and a member of the Burial Board and the Public Library Committee.
He was also co-secretary of the Enfield British School and chairman of the local Sunday School Union. [/p] [p]

You do not need a complete conventional circuit with a long downwind leg, although this will obviously give you more time in which to have a better look at the field.
But whatever happens, you must get into a good position for the start of the base leg. [/p] [p]
Unless you have a great deal of spare height, do not try to fly right round the field.
Experience shows that people often run themselves short of height on the way right round.
Instead, they could have stayed on the side they were flying and made a right, instead of a left circuit, with height to spare.
The positioning is made easier by imagining your field to be the normal landing area on your home site and by using the same angle for the positioning. [/p] [p]
Since it is usual in training to make <head>circuit</head>patterns from 800 feet or so, inexperienced pilots are often seriously put out if they find themselves unable to do this on a field landing.

Nevertheless, even if the level of precision demanded by the computational approach has not yet been realized in most instances, the approach does have other benefits.
The main one has been to make us think more closely about how the visual system might be organized.
One of the major points to emerge from computational theory is that the best way of achieving a representation of the environment is via a modular system that represents different properties of the environment in different parts of the system.
Mathematically this is relatively straightforward.
It means little more than that you can compute the direction and velocity of movement of an object independently of its colour or its depth.
In terms of how the visual system is organized it raises the exciting possibility that different properties of objects are computed by anatomically distinct <head>circuits</head> .

The latter is at approximately 20kHz, which means that the filter must severely attenuate frequencies above about 10kHz. [/p] [p]
The filter is a third order (18dB per octave) type having a cut-off frequency of about 6kHz.
This means that the reverberation signal has something less than the full audio bandwidth, but a bandwidth of about 6kHz is sufficient to give a good effect.
A wider bandwidth could be achieved at the expense of a shorter delay time, but this would not give such a good reverberation effect. [/p] [p]
The two-phase clock signal for the delay line is provided by a matching clock generator chip.
This also generates a bias signal required by the delay line chip.

In 1958, Rank had amalgamated the Odeon and Gaumont circuits, in defiance of an earlier undertaking not to do so.
The result was that producers wishing to secure a reasonable return from the British market had to persuade either the Rank or the ABPC booker to take their film.
With only two circuits to book, and programmes changing less frequently than hitherto, fewer films were required.
And while both conglomerates needed independent producers to supply them with quota films (they showed 49 British first features between them in 1963), the supply was sufficiently buoyant that they could pick and choose.

Then check it is clear below and attempt a straight stall, followed by a few stalls in very gentle turns.

That a country can achieve a current account surplus of &dollar;20 billion with negligible energy resources and a daily bill for oil alone of well over &dollar; 100 million, is testimony to Japanese industrial strength and flexibility. [/p] [p]
One major reason for Japan's success in coping with the high cost energy environment since 1979 has been the remarkable reduction in oil (and total energy) use without sacrificing economic growth.
Between 1979 and 1983 energy consumption in Japan has fallen by 8%.
Oil consumption has fallen by over 20%. [/p] [p]
However, during the same period the Japanese economy has been growing at about 3% per year.
How has this remarkable reduction in the energy co-efficient been achieved?
One of the main factors has been a shift away from energy intensive industries and an increasing concentration on low energy, high technology sectors such as integrated <head>circuits</head>and computers.

Most multimeters have ranges which are designed for measuring voltage, current and resistance.
Only a few are versatile enough to permit measurement of capacitance.
Following the two multimeter add-ons described in the last two instalments of Circuit Surgery, several readers have suggested that a simple device for directly measuring capacitance would be extremely useful.
With this in mind, I set about designing a circuit which could be used with an existing meter (preferably a digital type). [/p] [p]
The capacitance adapter can be highly recommended to anyone who needs a quick and effective means of measuring polyester, polystyrene and ceramic capacitors. [/p] [p]

Here, for instance, there is no doubt that Niki was of substantial help in closing the deal which brought McLaren the hugely successful TAG/Porsche engine, developed by Porsche but financed and sponsored by Mansour Ojjeh, the son of the head of Techniques d'Avant Garde, a French high-tech company with a substantial role in the development of weaponry. [/p] [p]
Because FI, in the wake of Renault, was shifting towards the turbo engine and because McLaren was beginning to develop the TAG/ Porsche engine, 1982 was something of a transitional year at the team and both Niki and his team-mate John Watson suffered in the results table, Watson actually finishing ahead of Niki in the championship, the first time he had ever been upstaged within his own team.
The year belonged to Keke Rosberg at Williams &mdash; though Ferrari's Didier Pironi might well have won the championship had it not been for his grave accident in the rain at Hockenheim.
Williams had soundness and reliability going for them; the rest of the field was extremely well balanced. [/p] [p]

NOR gate controls oscillator frequency [/head] [p]
You can make a simple, stable frequency-shift-keying (FSK) generator by adding an exclusive- [hi]OR [/hi] gate to a standard cmos oscillator.
In this circuit (figure), the data input controls gate [hi]IC ID [/hi] establishing positive or negative feedback around the oscillator formed by [hi]IC IA IC IB [/hi] and [hi]IC IC [/hi]. [/p] [p]
When the data input goes low, [hi]IC ID [/hi] enters its non-inverting mode, and [hi]R2 [/hi] increases capacitor C's charging rate.
When the input returns high, [hi]IC ID [/hi] inverts, and [hi]R2 [/hi] reduces C's charging current, thus lowering the oscillator's frequency. [/p] [p]
[hi]R1 [/hi] and C set the oscillator's frequency range, and [hi]R2 [/hi] determines the <head>circuit</head> 's frequency shift.

When applications that year were made, Lauda and others were smart enough to realize that the licences had been so designed as to tie them to their teams, a move cleverly designed by certain constructors to lower the price war among drivers and to prevent desertions in the ranks.
The hidden agenda, which has never been properly discussed, was an attempt by American superagent Mark McCormack to muscle into the world of FI via Didier Pironi, then president of the drivers' association. [/p] [p]

Researchers from Hitachi Europe Ltd's Cambridge Laboratory, working with Cambridge University's Microelectronics Research Centre claim to have fabricated a memory cell that uses a single electron to store one bit, vastly reducing the power that would be required by huge-capacity memory chips &mdash; a device the size of a silver dollar could store 1T-bits while drawing just 0.1W: in current technology it would be the size of a tennis court and dissipate 10KW.
The one-bit device developed by the Cambridge scientists utilises the so-called Coulomb Blockade Effect where, if an isolated area of conductor is made suitably small, the change of energy resulting from the gain or loss of an electron prevents further electrons from entering, and existing ones from leaving.
The memory node itself is a small conducting region connected to an external <head>circuit</head>by a [corr] multiple [/corr] tunnel junction and controlled by special gate capacitors.

Judicious use of this &bquo;band gap engineering&equo;, which calls for sound physical chemistry, allows the exploitation of valence to conduction band switching of electrons.
In any semiconductor electrons move freely through a crystalline lattice and because the conduction electrons are shared by all the atoms the lattice takes on a tube-like character for easy passage of electrons. [/p] [p]
In GaAs chips arrays of gallium and arsenic atoms provide a weaker attraction for moving electrons than in silicon chips &mdash; the electrons have a small effective mass, travel faster &gt;10 [hi]6 [/hi] cm s [hi]-1 [/hi], and go further between collisions than electrons in silicon.

reluctantly concluded that a few of Mr. Miller's quotations from Mr. Hubbard

As the market tumbled, disorderly market conditions prevailed: The margins
between buying bids and selling bids widened; trading in many stocks was
suspended; orders took unduly long to be executed; and many specialists
stopped trading altogether.  These failures in turn contributed to the fall
in the market averages: Uncertainty extracted an extra risk premium and
margin-calls triggered additional selling pressures.  The situation was

``I have not seen one iota of evidence'' to support restrictions on program
trading, says a Vanderbilt University finance professor, Hans Stoll, an
authority on the subject.  Says the Big Board's Mr. Phelan, ``Volatility is
greater than program trading.'' The Oct. 13 plunge was triggered not by
program traders, but by news of the unraveling of the $6.79 billion buy-out
of UAL Corp.  Unable to unload UAL and other airline shares, takeover-stock
speculators, or risk arbitragers, dumped every blue-chip stock they had.

A deeper market plunge today could give them their first test.  A further
slide also would resurrect debate over a host of other, more sweeping
changes proposed -- but not implemented -- after the last crash.  Most
notably, several of the regulatory steps recommended by the Brady Task Force,
which analyzed the 1987 crash, would be revived -- especially because that
group's chairman is now the Treasury secretary.  The most controversial of
the Brady recommendations involved establishing a single overarching
regulator to handle crucial cross-market questions, such as setting
consistent margin requirements for the stock and futures markets.  But for
the moment, attention focuses on the reforms that were put into place, and
market regulators and participants said the <head>circuit</head>

At the outset the prime target was program trading, which was much
discussed but little understood on Capitol Hill.  There were also calls to
strip the stock markets of ``derivative'' products, such as stock-index
futures and options, which Federal Judge Stanley Sporkin, for example,
likened to ``barnacles attached to the basic market.'' And there was much
criticism of the New York Stock Exchange's system of having stock trades
flow through specialists, or market makers.  When the Brady Task Force's
powerful analysis of the crash was released in January 1988, it immediately
reshaped the reformers 'agenda.  Arguing that the separate financial
marketplaces acted as one, and concluding that the crash had ``raised the
possibility of a full-scale financial system breakdown,'' the presidential
task force called for establishing a super-regulator to oversee the markets,
to make margins consistent across markets, to unify clearing systems and to

The New York Stock Exchange adopted two specific circuit breakers: If the
Dow Jones index falls 250 points in a day, the exchange will halt trading
for one hour; if the decline hits 400 points, the exchange will close for
an additional two hours.  The rationale is that an interruption of trading
will allow investors to reconsider their strategies, calm sellers and lead
buyers to enter the market at indicated new price levels.  It is impossible
to know whether that theory is realistic.  A temporary cessation of trading
may indeed discourage a selling panic from feeding on itself.  But there is
also the possibility that shutting down markets will intensify fears and
cause an even more abrupt slide in prices.  What happened Friday was the
worst of all worlds.  The futures exchanges followed their own pre-set
<head>circuit</head> breakers and shut down at about 3 p.m. for 30
minutes, after the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 stock index had fallen 12 points,

In the 1987 crash, remember, the market was shaken by a Danny Rostenkowski
proposal to tax takeovers out of existance.  Even more important, in our
view, was the Treasury's threat to thrash the dollar.  The Treasury is
doing the same thing today; thankfully, the dollar is not under 1987-style
pressure.  Also, traders are in better shape today than in 1987 to survive
selling binges.  They are better capitalized.  They are in less danger of

I spent a week at Saintes-Maries, and to get there I drove in a diligence across the Camargue with its vineyards, moors, and flat fields like Holland.
There, at Saintes-Maries, were girls who reminded me of Cimabue and Giotto &mdash; thin, straight, somewhat sad and mystic.
On the perfectly flat sandy beach little green, red, blue boats, so pretty in shape and colour that they made one think of flowers&hellip; [/p] [p]
What I should like to find out is the effect of an intenser blue in the sky.
Fromentin and Gerome see the soil of the South as colourless, and a lot of people see it like that.
My God, yes, if you take some sand in your hand, if you look at it closely and also water, and also air, they are all <head>colourless</head> , looked&quot; at in this way.

Her husband considered pushing the dog on to the floor, thought better of it, and went sulkily off to bed.
His daughter's beauty had never ceased to surprise the chief inspector.

Placed to the rear of the Lusignan retinue, the company of Nicholas barely heard the clipped and formal exchanges demanded by protocol, or the clink of the keys as they were handed over, or the flourish of trumpets that heralded the raising of the Lusignan banner on every wall.
Behind Napoleone Lomellini and his noblemen; behind the Pallaviccino, the Doria, the families of Gentile, Verdure, Archerio, de Pastino and the ranked faces, filled with hate, of the soldiers, there stood the men hitherto guarded as hostages.
The Arab Abul Ismail, erect and gaunt and impassive in turban and robes.
And beside him, a strong, familiar frame unfamiliarly reduced, on which hung the soiled and ill-fitting clothes of a labourer.

Helen stared at the oak chest and wondered what was in it.
She couldn't remember anyone having opened it in years.
There was a torn squab cushion on the top and it was traditionally used as a place to dump coats, scarves and gloves.
Helen thought she could distantly recall having seen it open with her mother upended over it, rummaging.
It had been Dorothy's territory, as indeed had all of the house, except for areas of communal use.
It occurred to Helen &mdash; listening to Louise, contemplating the chest &mdash; that in all the years she and Edward had lived at Greystones they had fully occupied only their own bedrooms; elsewhere, they perched. [/p] [p]
As soon as Louise had rung off she removed the cushion and opened the chest.
The contents reeked of damp.

The Anglo Saxons' solution to chapping and peeling was a poultice of beet, lettuce, coriander, herbs and crumbs mixed with water.

Sabine got the seatbelt off at last, and heaved and dragged the woman, arms and legs trailing, clear of the car.

Two-thirds of all national sulphur dioxide emissions are generated by coal-fired power stations with the majority of the emissions produced by a limited number of sites.
For example, 50 individual stations in 15 states account for half of all power station emissions.
Year-to-year variations in sulphur dioxide concentrations occur such as the 1 per cent increase between 1987 and 1988 [gap] [pb] [gap] and the 3 per cent decrease between 1988 and 1989.
Nationally, the urban sulphur dioxide problem has diminished to the point where only a small number of urban sites now exceed the air quality standard.
Remaining sulphur dioxide problem locations are found near large industrial sources such as around non-ferrous [pb] [gap] smelters located outside urban areas in the intermontane region of the western United States and in Arizona. [/p] [p]

The new ZIG Kurecolor Twin KC-1100 and the ZIG Kurecolor KC-400 Brush Pens are professional marker systems designed for use by illustrators, graphic designers and all professional artists. [/p] [p]
To understand fully the potential of this medium you need to appreciate that a professional marker range offers a massive array of colour, tone and possible variations of technique.
The Kurecolor KC-1100 range boasts 106 different values; each pen is twin pointed, carrying as standard a broad, oblique cut tip for wide and medium fine use and a fine point for line and detail.
These points are also interchangeable.
Nine styles are available, including a calligraphy tip and a flexible brush point.
The range is accompanied by a Blender Pen of <head>colourless</head> fluid that may be used to soften colours into graduated effects and by a Blank Pen Kit that enables you to make a marker carrying a colour of your own choice. [/p] [p]

You can have a lot of fun shooting city lights, but there are one or two points to watch out for if you are going to come away with some really effective shots.
Remember that even if the precinct appears brightly lit to the eye, your camcorder will probably be working flat out to expose for the wide shots.
The brightest objects are of course the lights themselves, but wide shots also include the darker areas which reduce the average brightness of the scene.
The lens aperture will probably be working fully open, and this may over-expose the lights which will then tend to flare. [/p] [p]
When you are shooting night-scenes such as these, avoid shots which are simply of decorative street lights against a dark sky.
These can be disappointing because the camcorder's auto-exposure system, in opening up the lens aperture to maximise the average brightness of the shot, will probably record the coloured lights as <head>colourless</head> points of light. [/p] [p]

The BHE party, as a result, did not become the right-wing nationalist party which many had feared.
(One neo-Nazi party which was formed in 1951, the Socialist Reichs Party, was quickly banned by the Constitutional Court.)
In the election, the BHE won 27 seats but most other small parties, including the Communists, lost all their seats and the CDU (45 per cent of the vote) reaped the benefit.
The FDP (9.5 per cent) stayed in coalition with the CDU, and the SDP (29 per cent) were again disappointed.
The SPD was alienated both by Adenauer's determinedly pro-Western foreign policy and by Erhard's social market.
But the Soviet's ruthless response to the June 1953 East [pb] Berlin rising had seemed to prove Adenauer's pro-Western policy right and, after Schumacher's death in August 1952, the SPD were led by the well-meaning but <head>colourless</head> Erich Ollenhauer. [/p] [p]

We expect to find the missing information in the largely unexplored group of algae and protozoans.
So far, only one green algal mitochondrial genome has been extensively characterized: that of [hi]C.reinhardtii [/hi] has been almost completely sequenced (for a review see 20).
Partial mitochondrial sequences of the green algae [hi]Scenedesmus obliquus [/hi] and [hi]Chlamydomonas smithii [/hi] have also been published (21, 22).
The mtDNA from [hi]C.reinhardtii [/hi] is strikingly unlike the plant or any other known mitochondrial genome from eukaryotes and there is little indication that [hi]C.reinhardtii [/hi] and plants share a common mitochondrial ancestor (23, 24). [/p] [p]

The answer is partly that the vote in Rhineland-Palatinate, which lies just below Bonn, is now out of the way; partly that he may regain some of his lost esteem in eastern Germany, where voters are heavily for Berlin; but not least that Mr Kohl has almost always come back fighting after getting a slap in the face. [/p] [p]
The result in Rhineland-Palatinate, Mr Kohl's home state, must have hurt.
The Christian Democrats got only 38.7% of the vote, against 45.1% four years ago, and are being booted out of the government for the first time since the state was founded 45 years ago.
The Social Democrats jumped to 44.8% from 38.8% and can choose to form a coalition with either the Greens or the Free Democrats, which is likelier. [/p] [p]
There were some local reasons for the defeat.
The Christian Democrats had a <head>colourless</head> premier, who was at odds with a too pushy local party chairman.

Radon exposure is the hottest issue among radiation scientists today &mdash; but it remains almost entirely unknown to the public.
Neither environmentalists nor the nuclear industry seem to like talking about it.

The nuclear industry, for its part, does not seem to enjoy publicising the ill effects of radiation in any form. [/p] [/quote] [/p] [p]
These reasons may not be entirely true, but since formal advice on radon exposure was first issued in 1987 by the National Radiological Protection Board (NRPB) great concern has arisen in the few areas of the country that have high radon levels. [/p] [div2] [head]

Goddard gives the impression of a House working seriously and in accordance with traditional procedures towards the performance of its roles, especially the legislative one.
Though in the event this was an addled Parliament, it was by no means fain&eacute;ant.
A good many bills, public and private, quite apart from the major one intended to revise in a parliamentary way the Instrument of Government, were introduced and pursued, as Goddard, who was a conscientious attender, suggests, mostly without acrimony, though references to &bquo;the court party&equo; and &bquo;the soldiery and courtiers&equo; indicate underlying partisanships.

(Copied from the [hi]Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society [/hi], A.D. 1808): Sir, According to your request, I send you an account of the facts I have ascertained, respecting a canal I discovered in the year 1803 in the medulla spinalis of the horse, bullock, sheep, hog and dog: and should it appear to you deserving of being laid before the Royal Society, I shall feel myself particularly obliged by having so great an honour conferred upon me.
Upon tracing the sixth ventricle of the brain, which corresponds to the fourth in the human subject, to its apparent termination, the calamus scriptorius, I perceived the appearance of a canal, continuing by a direct course into the centre of the spinal marrow.
To ascertain with accuracy whether such structure existed throughout its whole length, I made sections of the spinal marrow at different distances from the brain, and found that each divided portion exhibited an orifice with a diameter sufficient to admit a large sized pin; from which a small quantity of transparent <head>colourless</head> fluid issued like that contained in the ventricles of the brain.

It must be stressed that there is no direct evidence linking radon and lung cancer.
Yet the overwhelming opinion is that a significant proportion of lung cancer deaths in the UK are caused by radon, and that people who are likely to have long exposure to high radon levels are at extreme risk.
Although it is relatively simple and inexpensive to radon-proof a house, the social and political problems raised are enormous.
If the problem was widely publicised, certain regions of the country with high radon levels could find the value of their housing stock drastically reduced.
Would firms move into areas with high radon concentrations? [/p] [p]

At one extreme of the southern oscillation the pressure over Australia is low and that over the Pacific is high; at the other extreme, as in 1982, the situation is reversed.
During this drought the amplitude of this effect has been bigger than at any time since reliable pressure records for the region were first taken 50 years ago. [/p] [p]
The southern oscillation reverses irregularly, but typically at intervals of from two to five years.
It has its own associated pattern of atmospheric circulation, named after Sir Gilbert Walker who identified it early in this century (Figure 3), and it is also associated with changes in the pattern of surface temperature.
At present, with Walker circulation flowing west to east at low level there is warm surface water in the eastern Pacific and <head>cool</head>surface water in the west.

Instead of facing the music at Wembley on September 9, Taylor's team will play for expenses only on a Spanish Second Division ground that holds only 25,000 spectators and has never before staged a full international match. [/p] [p]
The switch has surprised Wembley, who expected a home game against Spain, and has disappointed the Spanish FA, who hoped they were being invited to London for only the second time in 20 years. [/p] [p]
Javier Clemente, Spain's new manager, says: &bquo;Everybody knows how I admire English football and how I wanted Wembley as the perfect place for my debut match.&equo; [/p] [p]

Light: Requires good, but not too strong light.
Water temperature: A wide range of temperature is tolerated, 62&deg;&ndash;76&deg;F.

The skill with which the royal family have identified not merely the good causes which will garner public sympathy, but some of the issues which tap the popular pulse has enabled them to weather any potential challenge from republicans.
It is their good fortune to have the luxury of comment without the responsibility of action that enables them to appear more in tune with public feeling than the ideologists of either side of the political spectrum.
The House of Windsor has become highly adept at the business of its own survival.
That there is no popular opposition is testimony not only to how successful they have been, but also to the fact that there appears to be simply no desirable alternative: the British just do not like their politicians enough to want them made head of state. [/p] [p]

He, more than anybody in sport, personified cool: he boxed with the most consummate self-assurance, drifting around the ring almost somnambulistically, often dispensing with his guard and rapidly discharging clusters of punches.
In his 1980 title defence against Colin Jones, a white Welshman, he performed with his usual calmness, accumulating points with ridiculous ease for the first eight rounds.
Then, quite unexpectedly, he took a clubbing right hand to the head and lost complete co-ordination.
He did not react but lay back grasping the top rope.
Jones mounted a quick two-fisted assault and the title changed hands in those brief, dramatic seconds.
Laing was at pains to stress that at no time did he feel under pressure: &bquo;It was that I'd never been caught before and I didn't know what to do.

With the talk of &bquo;new&equo; British soul talent still on the rise (and much of it obviously focused on Don-E and Omar), the name of Noel has at last began to get some recognition.
It was the tail-end of the Seventies when a frighteningly young Noel McKoy and some schoolmates formed the Albians and recorded the all-time classic lovers' rock tune &bquo;Princess&equo;.
Throughout the next decade, McKoy developed and honed his music.
Appearances with the James Taylor Quartet and a collaboration with Snowboy followed.
When Noel teamed up with brothers Cornelle and Robin and sister Junette to form a steady working unit &mdash; McKoy &mdash; things really started.
The &bquo;Family&equo; single (featured on &bquo;Rebirth Of <head>Cool</head>Too&equo;) confirmed excited whispers: this was great soul music.

She had whispered her own last goodbye at a Liverpool dockyard gate, though she had not known it.
Two months ago on an innocent [pb] April afternoon, yet already she had lived through a lifetime of sorrow.
Now another life was about to begin, one in which she was no more than a surname and number, a woman who had lifted her hand in salute and sworn allegiance to King and country.
For as long as the war lasted, she would be a part of the Royal Navy and there could be no remembered yesterdays, no thoughts of tomorrow.
One day at a time was how it now must be, and this one day she was adrift, tired and hungry, with new flat-heeled shoes that hurt like hell. [/p] [p]
Briefly she closed her eyes, mentally peeling off the scratchy black stockings, lowering her feet inch by beautiful inch into a bowl of <head>cool</head>water.

Feed under your trees [/head] [p]
Favourable soil conditions affect a plant's chances of survival beneath trees.
Very often the soil is dry and hungry (deficient in nutrients), especially near evergreens and vigorously rooting hedge species such as privet.
Working quantities of organic material into the top few inches will markedly improve some plants' performance. [/p] [p]
Massed conifers cast dense shadows and their fallen needles can upset the acid/alkaline balance of the soil.
Some thinning may be necessary to admit enough light for plants such as rhododendrons, pieris and hostas to thrive. [/p] [p]
Unless very dense, the shady conditions produced by most garden trees can be turned to advantage by creating a miniature woodland that will suit shade-loving plants and offer a <head>cool</head>oasis in a hot summer. [/p] [p]

Lloyd C. Winter, an established American coach, lends Kane's theory some credence: &bquo;As a class, the Black athletes who have trained under me are far ahead of whites in that one factor &mdash; relaxation under pressure&equo; (Kane, 1971, p.76).
But let me balance this with an inside view from triple jumper Aston Moore: [quote] [p]
Everyone used to say to me, &bquo;how do you manage to stay so cool and relaxed for a big event, Aston?&equo;
If only they could know how I feel every time I compete!
If they could have only known what's going on in my head.
I suffer from so much tension it's not true.
The thing is I disguise it.
But my head is totally taut. [/p] [/quote] [pb] [/p] [p]

If you are planning to try them again this year, take the precaution of choosing quick-maturing varieties in case this summer doesn't turn out to be as sunny. [/p] [p]
Good sweetcorn varieties are Candle (one of the new super-sweet types), Kelvedon Sweetheart and Sunrise.
The tomatoes Red Alert and Tornado should give reasonable crops outdoors in a dull summer &mdash; at least in the southern half of the country. [/p] [p]
IF THE summer turns out to be hot, it will be a lot less work if you plant outdoor tomatoes in the ground rather than in growing bags.
Where you are short of garden space, try the dwarf varieties Pixie (large fruit) or Tiny Tim (small fruit) in tubs. [/p] [p]
Most traditional vegetables do best in a <head>cool</head> , wet summer, so incorporate as much organic matter as possible and consider using strips of black polythene between rows to reduce the need for watering in a good summer.

After removing ten to fifteen worms from the upturned roots the piece of lawn is returned to its original position, patted down firmly and is none the worse within a week or two.
Alternatively, digging round the compost heap will usually yield a lot of earthworms. [/p] [p]
Small earthworms can be fed whole to fish, while the bigger ones need chopping up.
This can be done easily using a scalpel blade, an old fashioned razor blade or a small sharp knife which is used solely for this purpose. [/p] [p]
Some fishkeepers freeze clean earthworms for later use, but I always tend to use them fresh.
With the milder winters we are experiencing nowadays, earthworms are available all the year round.
Earthworms can also be stored alive in damp leaf mould placed in an icecream tub which has had small holes punched in the lid.

Brooklyn's Polo cult originated largely in the Crown Heights section of the borough, at the corner of Utica and St John's Avenues.

IT WAS Julian Critchley &mdash; genial man of letters, biographer of Michael Heseltine, wholesale supplier of parliamentary anecdotes (repeat orders a speciality) and also a Tory MP &mdash; who noted that &bquo;politicians are happiest when talking, at their most miserable when making up their minds.&equo; [/p] [p]
His biographee would dissent; Mr Heseltine believes in politicians as shirt-sleeved doers.
For the cabinet as a whole, though, talking about the need to replace or reform the poll tax proved easier than finally deciding on its replacement.
The story of how ministers did so provides the first substantial evidence about how John Major's government is functioning behind closed doors. [/p] [p]
The first point is that both ministers and officials involved in the review stress the lack of drama, tantrum-throwing and brinkmanship.
Instead, it was &bquo;collegiate&equo; and &bquo;a classic example of old-fashioned cabinet government&equo;.
It suits the powers-that-be to draw a distinction between the livid chiaroscuro of Mrs Thatcher's reign and the plain, <head>cool</head>daylight of the current regime.

Large bulbs should be only half-buried; with smaller ones, the tips should be just below the compost surface. [/p] [p]
Do not mix different species of bulbs, or different varieties of one species, in the same container.
They are likely to flower at different times and the effect will be untidy.
If you want a mixture of species and colours, grow individual bulbs separately in plant pots and then plant up an arrangement using bulbs which have reached the same stage of development and look to be just about to flower. [/p] [/div2] [div2] [head]
Plunge power [/head] [p]
It is essential that bulbs spend a period of time in cool, dark conditions before flowering (this is known as plunging) to ensure that a good root system is produced, otherwise stunted growth and deformed flowers can result.
Older gardening books may recommend a <head>cool</head>cupboard indoors for plunging.

Some 360 million years ago the beginnings of dense forests showed up in the fossil record, with tall, looming foliage.
It was shortly after, during the Carboniferous period when the first reptiles appeared, that really massive tree-growth was achieved.

Meanwhile, big, butch rappers like LL Cool J and Public Enemy are held up as authentic voices of the Male Ghetto Experience (usually by middle-class white semioticians), but if anything rap is even more the product of flatulent ego and opportunist marketing than anything by Bros or Kylie Minogue.

The cornflower-blue dress she had brought to wear at the finals had been slept on by Ethel and was impossibly creased, as was her face after two nights sleeping in the car.
Her legs, not brown enough, were becoming bristly. [/p] [p]
She was miserably aware of getting on Perdita's nerves, and, as all the fathers had rolled up, of the loneliness of being a woman on one's own.
She was almost abject with gratitude to Drew who'd insisted she use his Land-Rover as her base, and who'd come up specially that morning to invite her to lunch and to watch the match with him and Sukey. [/p] [p]
Among the Pony Club, Daisy noticed, Drew was a Superman.
A fortnight ago he had played for England against America in the annual International.
Only his two hard-fought goals and grimly consistent defence had prevented the game turning into a rout.
Now he couldn't move twenty yards without signing autographs.
In his <head>cool</head>way Drew found this gratifying. [/p] [p]

Austin is a good deal smaller than Edinburgh, but has about as much motorway as the UK.

&bquo;Look &mdash; Hyde Park!&equo; shouted Jackie.
&bquo;Stella said that's near the campus &mdash; very posh.&equo;
But next to the Hyde Park Drug Store is the Hyde Park Tattoo Parlor, and The Texas Plasma Center (&bquo;Earn &dollar;&dollar; in your spare time!&equo;) and the Wild Snail Pawn Shoppe. [/p] [p]
But clinging to the numbered street grid system we found, and flopped into, our riverside home. [/p] [p]
All the frogs legs you can eat &mdash; Monday nite &dollar;7.95 &mdash; [hi]sign at Cactus Joe's Watering Hole [/hi] [/p] [p]
The apartment was new, and <head>cool</head> , and decently furnished, and we liked it.

But familiarity was not the only factor.
The rhetoric of cruelty and inhumanity in 1792, and more clearly in 1806, aroused ambivalence as to its persuasive effect in parliament, even amongst some abolitionists, because they feared the impact of &bquo;enthusiasm&equo; upon their colleagues.
Fox in 1792 and Romilly in 1806 were prepared to take the risk.
They used the language of murder about the slave trade and Fox proclaimed himself an enthusiast for &bquo;that zeal and warmth which arose from a sense of justice and was that kind which made men act with energy in [pb] a noble cause&equo;.
Other opponents of the trade, however, deliberately distanced themselves from &bquo;fanaticism&equo;.
In 1792 Whitbread stressed his commitment to &bquo;a <head>cool</head>and moderate proceeding in the course of justice and humanity&equo;.

The quality of your protection is subject to your moralising attitude on the way a country is run!, [/p] [p]
&bquo;I'm not a politician, Colonel,&equo; said Cowley coldly. [/p] [p]
&bquo;We have all been branded murderers,&equo; Lin Foh persisted.
&bquo;Your Government listens to the terrorist propaganda.
We are in exile, or we are dead, those of us who ruled firmly but fairly.
I am from a line of Princes, Major Cowley.
I am not afraid to die.
But not wastefully.
If I were still a Minister of my country you would be giving me real protection, day and night.
I want that now.&equo; [/p] [p]
Tired of the wheedling tone, the persistent arrogance of the man, Cowley lost his <head>cool</head>and turned on the colonel.

The art (therapy?) of Reflexology is founded on the principle that massaging the feet can affect the health of other parts of the body, a fact which acupuncture has known for a long time.
It should therefore come as no surprise that gentle washing and drying of feet promote a feeling of wellbeing at the very least. [/p] [p]
Just think of those winter evenings when you came home with feet like blocks of ice.
A basin of hot water was prepared.
A spoonful of yellow mustard was added and &mdash; oh joy of joys &mdash; as the feet were immersed a feeling of transcendent pleasure stole over you.
Or just reverse the situation.
It is a long hot summer's day.
You have laboured up an unending hill with heavy feet which are swollen, sore and tired.
A gurgling burn looms before you and in its <head>cool</head>streams you immerse your weary feet.

This win is for her.

Queen Of Shannon's jockey Michael Tebbutt showed plenty of enterprise when he and John Reid were the only riders to stick to the far rail for most of the race &mdash; and they finished first and second. [/p] [p]

Having spotted his prey in a channel which could be fifty yards wide or more, the fisherman must literally read the fish's [pb] mind.
Which run would the fish take?
Almost blind in the shallow muddy water, it is swimming by instinct, following the deepest sand channels.
The prongs of the lave net are probably three to four feet apart, and side stepping in fast waist deep water is a slow business.
He will only get one chance.
If he fails to judge the correct line of the fish's swim, it can pass either side of him; sometimes a frustrating arms length away. [/p] [p]
&bquo;They had any luck d'you know?&equo;
Yanto returned his gaze to the top of Selwyn's bald pate, weathered almost black by his long outdoor life. [/p] [p]

Maybe she could drop by at the Metropolitan Opera and bring along what she
forgot, a little charm, a few smidgins of thespian skills and a nice wig.
Cast as Violetta Valery in a new production of Verdi's ``La Traviata,'' Ms.
Gruberova last week did many things nicely and others not so well.  It is
n't every day that we hear a Violetta who can sing the first act's
high-flying music with all the little notes perfectly pitched and neatly
stitched together.  Never once did she gasp for air or mop her brow.  She
was as <head>cool</head> as a cucumber.

On Aug. 1, the state tore up its controls, and food prices leaped.  Without
buffer stocks, inflation exploded.  That was when the tame old Peasants '
Party, desperate to live through the crisis, broke ranks with the
Communists and joined with Solidarity in the East Bloc's first liberated
government.  But by the time Solidarity took office in September, the
damage was done.  ``Shortageflation,'' as economists have come to call it,
had gone hyper.  The cost of raising a pig kept bounding ahead of the
return for selling one.  The farmers stayed angry.  They still are.  At
dawn on a <head>cool</head> day, hundreds travel to the private
market in Radzymin, a town not far from Warsaw, hauling pigs, cattle and
sacks of feed that the state's official buyers ca n't induce them to sell.

Terms call for First Security to issue about 0.55 share of its stock for
each Deseret share held, or a total of about 550,000 First Security shares.
It has about 12.3 million shares outstanding.  Deseret, with about $100
million in assets, is the parent of the Deseret Bank, which has six offices
and headquarters at Pleasant Grove, Utah.  The purchase price is equal to
about 1.65 times Deseret's roughly $10.7 million book value, or assets less
liabilities.  Salt Lake City-based First Security, with $5.4 billion in
assets, said the agreement is subject to shareholder and regulatory approval,
and that it hopes to complete the transaction early next year.
Georgia-Pacific Corp.'s unsolicited $3.19 billion bid for Great Northern
Nekoosa Corp. was hailed by Wall Street despite a <head>cool</head>

``The thing about the Dinkins candidacy is that it offers hope to a broad
range of people,'' says Meyer Frucher, a real-estate executive and former
aide to Gov. Mario Cuomo.  ``It is a feel-good candidacy.'' No doubt, Mr.
Dinkins has been a calming influence.  He is an avuncular figure who
remembers the birthdays of colleagues 'children, opens doors for women, and
almost never has a bad word to say about anybody.  More important, he
emerged as a peacemaker last summer after the Central Park rape of a white
jogger -- in which a group of Harlem teens was charged -- and the racial
murder of a black teen-ager in the white Brooklyn neighborhood of
Bensonhurst.  Rather than scaring off white voters, as many predicted he
would, Mr. Dinkins attracted many whites precisely because of his
reputation for having a <head>cool</head> head.
